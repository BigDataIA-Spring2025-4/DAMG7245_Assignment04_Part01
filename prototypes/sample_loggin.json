      "response": "The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C. (District of Columbia).\n\nHere are a few reasons why Washington, D.C., is the capital:\n\n1. **Historical Choice**: The location of the capital was decided by George Washington, the first President of the United States. He chose a site along the Potomac River, on land donated by Maryland and Virginia, to ensure that the capital would be located in the middle of the country, promoting unity among the states.\n\n2. **Separation of Powers**: Washington, D.C., is a federal district, not part of any state, which allows it to be a neutral ground for the federal government. This separation helps to ensure that the government is not influenced by the politics of any particular state.\n\n3. **Symbolic Importance**: The city is designed to be a symbol of the United States, with its iconic landmarks such as the White House, the Capitol Building, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Washington Monument. These structures represent the country's history, democracy, and values.\n\n4. **Government Functions**: Washington, D.C., is the seat of the federal government, housing the executive branch (the White House), the legislative branch (the Capitol Building), and the judicial branch (the Supreme Court). It is also home to numerous government agencies, international embassies, and cultural institutions.\n\n5. **Planning and Design**: The city was planned by Pierre Charles L'Enfant, a French-born architect and engineer, who designed it with a grand vision that included wide avenues, public spaces, and monuments. This design reflects the importance of the city as the nation's capital.\n\nThese factors combined make Washington, D.C., the ideal location for the capital of the United States.<|im_end|>",

It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the  list  being  primarily  based  on  the  ISO  standard  ISO  3166-1.  For  instance,  the  United  Kingdom  is considered  a  single  entity,  while  the  constituent  countries  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.119 billion as of 2024. [1]\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/CountrywisePopulationpdf/images/tmp93w2kbp__image_2.png)\n\n## Method\n\nFigures  used  in  this  chart  are  based  on  the  most  up-to-date  estimates  or  projections  by  the  national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2024 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\nBecause  the  compiled  figures  are  not  collected  at  the  same  time  in  every  country,  or  at  the  same  level  of  accuracy,  the  resulting  numerical  comparisons  may  create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union, [a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica. [2]\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n|     | Location                         | Population    | % of world   | Date        | Source

The European Union is a sui generis supranational union whose sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has 5.49% of the world's population - see \"Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface TGM table\" (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps0000 1/default/table?lang=en). European Commission.\n- b. According to UN estimates, India surpassed China by the end of April 2023. [4]\n- c. Refers to Mainland China; excludes China's special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\n- d. Includes the population of the India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.\n- e. Includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but excludes the territories of the United States.\n- f. Includes the population of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and GilgitBaltistan.\n- g. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics has a projection of 181 million for 2025, but this method derives from a base year of 2011. This same projection overcounted the population for 2022 by about 4.4 million. [13]\n- h. Includes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, administrative areas on the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia. The population does not include the four annexed Ukrainian oblasts. The Ukrainian government and most of the world's other states consider the Crimean Peninsula, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia parts of Ukraine's territory.\n- i. Includes the integral 18 regions of France (including 5 overseas departments and regions). Excludes France's 5 overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna, and the sui generis collectivity of New Caledonia, which are shown separately. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff) and Clipperton Island (an uninhabited state private property of France) are not listed at all due to their extraordinary nature.\n- j. Excludes the three British Crown Dependencies and the 14 British Overseas Territories, listed separately. Four British Overseas Territories are not listed due to their extraordinary nature. The four not listed are British Antarctic Territory (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff), the British Indian Ocean Territory (a military base), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (hosts only government officials and research station staff), and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (a military base where permanent residency is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus).\n- k.

It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the  list  being  primarily  based  on  the  ISO  standard  ISO  3166-1.  For  instance,  the  United  Kingdom  is considered  a  single  entity,  while  the  constituent  countries  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.119 billion as of 2024. [1]\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/CountrywisePopulationpdf/images/tmp93w2kbp__image_2.png)\n\n## Method\n\nFigures  used  in  this  chart  are  based  on  the  most  up-to-date  estimates  or  projections  by  the  national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2024 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\nBecause  the  compiled  figures  are  not  collected  at  the  same  time  in  every  country,  or  at  the  same  level  of  accuracy,  the  resulting  numerical  comparisons  may  create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union, [a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica. [2]\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n|     | Location                         | Population    | % of world   | Date        | Source

The European Union is a sui generis supranational union whose sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has 5.49% of the world's population - see \"Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface TGM table\" (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps0000 1/default/table?lang=en). European Commission.\n- b. According to UN estimates, India surpassed China by the end of April 2023. [4]\n- c. Refers to Mainland China; excludes China's special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\n- d. Includes the population of the India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.\n- e. Includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but excludes the territories of the United States.\n- f. Includes the population of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and GilgitBaltistan.\n- g. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics has a projection of 181 million for 2025, but this method derives from a base year of 2011. This same projection overcounted the population for 2022 by about 4.4 million. [13]\n- h. Includes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, administrative areas on the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia. The population does not include the four annexed Ukrainian oblasts. The Ukrainian government and most of the world's other states consider the Crimean Peninsula, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia parts of Ukraine's territory.\n- i. Includes the integral 18 regions of France (including 5 overseas departments and regions). Excludes France's 5 overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna, and the sui generis collectivity of New Caledonia, which are shown separately. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff) and Clipperton Island (an uninhabited state private property of France) are not listed at all due to their extraordinary nature.\n- j. Excludes the three British Crown Dependencies and the 14 British Overseas Territories, listed separately. Four British Overseas Territories are not listed due to their extraordinary nature. The four not listed are British Antarctic Territory (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff), the British Indian Ocean Territory (a military base), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (hosts only government officials and research station staff), and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (a military base where permanent residency is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus).\n- k. Includes Zanzibar.\n- l. Does not include the Rohingya people. Some regions were estimated by satellite. [34]\n- m. Includes the regions Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra and Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab, the disputed territory of Western Sahara administered by Morocco and excluding Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (see Western Sahara conflict).\n- n. Despite high reported precision, estimates vary widely. For 2024, the CIA gives an estimate of 40,121,552 [47] , while the UN gives an estimate of 42,045,000 [48] , based on the 1979 census and fertility, mortality and immigration estimates. [49] Official figure includes an estimated 1.5 million nomadic population.\n- o. Excludes the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine's de jure territory which is occupied by Russia (however, includes the Donbas region, partly occupied by Russia).\n- p. Excludes the external territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island.\nIf the question isn't related to the provided documents, politely inform the user that you can only answer questions about the selected documents."

It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the  list  being  primarily  based  on  the  ISO  standard  ISO  3166-1.  For  instance,  the  United  Kingdom  is considered  a  single  entity,  while  the  constituent  countries  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.119 billion as of 2024. [1]\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/CountrywisePopulationpdf/images/tmp93w2kbp__image_2.png)\n\n## Method\n\nFigures  used  in  this  chart  are  based  on  the  most  up-to-date  estimates  or  projections  by  the  national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2024 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\nBecause  the  compiled  figures  are  not  collected  at  the  same  time  in  every  country,  or  at  the  same  level  of  accuracy,  the  resulting  numerical  comparisons  may  create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union, [a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica. [2]\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n|     | Location                         | Population    | % of world   | Date        | Source

The European Union is a sui generis supranational union whose sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has 5.49% of the world's population - see \"Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface TGM table\" (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps0000 1/default/table?lang=en). European Commission.\n- b. According to UN estimates, India surpassed China by the end of April 2023. [4]\n- c. Refers to Mainland China; excludes China's special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\n- d. Includes the population of the India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.\n- e. Includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but excludes the territories of the United States.\n- f. Includes the population of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and GilgitBaltistan.\n- g. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics has a projection of 181 million for 2025, but this method derives from a base year of 2011. This same projection overcounted the population for 2022 by about 4.4 million. [13]\n- h. Includes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, administrative areas on the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia. The population does not include the four annexed Ukrainian oblasts. The Ukrainian government and most of the world's other states consider the Crimean Peninsula, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia parts of Ukraine's territory.\n- i. Includes the integral 18 regions of France (including 5 overseas departments and regions). Excludes France's 5 overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna, and the sui generis collectivity of New Caledonia, which are shown separately. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff) and Clipperton Island (an uninhabited state private property of France) are not listed at all due to their extraordinary nature.\n- j. Excludes the three British Crown Dependencies and the 14 British Overseas Territories, listed separately. Four British Overseas Territories are not listed due to their extraordinary nature. The four not listed are British Antarctic Territory (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff), the British Indian Ocean Territory (a military base), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (hosts only government officials and research station staff), and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (a military base where permanent residency is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus).\n- k. Includes Zanzibar.\n- l. Does not include the Rohingya people. Some regions were estimated by satellite. [34]\n- m. Includes the regions Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra and Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab, the disputed territory of Western Sahara administered by Morocco and excluding Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (see Western Sahara conflict).\n- n. Despite high reported precision, estimates vary widely. For 2024, the CIA gives an estimate of 40,121,552 [47] , while the UN gives an estimate of 42,045,000 [48] , based on the 1979 census and fertility, mortality and immigration estimates. [49] Official figure includes an estimated 1.5 million nomadic population.\n- o. Excludes the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine's de jure territory which is occupied by Russia (however, includes the Donbas region, partly occupied by Russia).\n- p. Excludes the external territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island."

It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the  list  being  primarily  based  on  the  ISO  standard  ISO  3166-1.  For  instance,  the  United  Kingdom  is considered  a  single  entity,  while  the  constituent  countries  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.119 billion as of 2024. [1]\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/CountrywisePopulationpdf/images/tmp93w2kbp__image_2.png)\n\n## Method\n\nFigures  used  in  this  chart  are  based  on  the  most  up-to-date  estimates  or  projections  by  the  national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2024 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\nBecause  the  compiled  figures  are  not  collected  at  the  same  time  in  every  country,  or  at  the  same  level  of  accuracy,  the  resulting  numerical  comparisons  may  create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union, [a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica. [2]\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n|     | Location                         | Population    | % of world   | Date        | Source

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t -1 and the input for position t . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n## 2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n\n## 3 Model Architecture\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to a sequence of continuous representations z = ( z 1 , ..., z n ) . Given z , the decoder then generates an output sequence ( y 1 , ..., y m ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_1.png)\n\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\n\n## 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x +Sublayer( x )) , where Sublayer( x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512 .\n\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i .\n\n## 3.2 Attention\n\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n\n## Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_3.png)\n\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n\n## 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension d k , and values of dimension d v . We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √ d k , and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q . The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\nAttention( Q,K,V ) = softmax( QK T √ d k ) V (1)\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1 √ d k . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of d k the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d k [3]. We suspect that for large values of d k , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4 . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1 √ d k .\n\n## 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with d model-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d k , d k and d v dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d v -dimensional\n\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.\n\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n\nMultiHead( Q,K,V ) = Concat(head 1 , ..., head h ) W O where head = Attention( QW Q , KW K , V W V )\n\ni i i i\n\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q i ∈ R d model × d k , W K i ∈ R d model × d k , W V i ∈ R d model × d v and W O ∈ R hd v × d model .\n\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use d k = d v = d model /h = 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n## 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n- · In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\n- · The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n- · Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -∞ ) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n\n## 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\nFFN( x ) = max(0 , xW 1 + b 1 ) W 2 + b 2 (2)\n\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is d model = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality d ff = 2048 .\n\n## 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension d model. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √ d model.\n\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel size of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\n\n| Layer Type                  | Complexity per Layer   | Sequential Operations   | Maximum Path Length   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Self-Attention              | O ( n 2 · d )          | O (1)                   | O (1)                 |\n| Recurrent                   | O ( n · d 2 )          | O ( n )                 | O ( n )               |\n| Convolutional               | O ( k · n · d 2 )      | O (1)                   | O ( log k ( n ))      |\n| Self-Attention (restricted) | O ( r · n · d )        | O (1)                   | O ( n/r )             |\n\n## 3.5 Positional Encoding\n\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\nPE ( pos, 2 i ) = sin ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model ) PE ( pos, 2 i +1) = cos ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model )\n\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2 π to 10000 · 2 π . We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k , PE pos + k can be represented as a linear function of PE pos .\n\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\n\n## 4 Why Self-Attention\n\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to another sequence of equal length ( z 1 , ..., z n ) , with x i , z i ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O ( n ) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d , which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O ( n/r ) . We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O ( n/k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O ( log k ( n )) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k . Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O ( k · n · d + n · d 2 ) . Even with k = n , however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n\n## 5 Training\n\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n\n## 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\n\n## 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\n\n## 5.3 Optimizer\n\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β 1 = 0 . 9 , β 2 = 0 . 98 and ϵ = 10 -9 . We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\nlrate = d -0 . 5 model · min( step \\_ num -0 . 5 , step \\_ num · warmup \\_ steps -1 . 5 ) (3)\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup \\_ steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup \\_ steps = 4000 .\n\n## 5.4 Regularization\n\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\n\n| Model                           | BLEU   | BLEU   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                 | EN-DE  | EN-FR  | EN-DE                   | EN-FR                   |\n| ByteNet [18]                    | 23.75  |        |                         |                         |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk [39]          |        | 39.2   |                         | 1 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL [38]                  | 24.6   | 39.92  | 2 . 3 · 10 19           | 1 . 4 · 10 20           |\n| ConvS2S [9]                     | 25.16  | 40.46  | 9 . 6 · 10 18           | 1 . 5 · 10 20           |\n| MoE [32]                        | 26.03  | 40.56  | 2 . 0 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 20           |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] |        | 40.4   |                         | 8 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL Ensemble [38]         | 26.30  | 41.16  | 1 . 8 · 10 20           | 1 . 1 · 10 21           |\n| ConvS2S Ensemble [9]            | 26.36  | 41.29  | 7 . 7 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 21           |\n| Transformer (base model)        | 27.3   | 38.1   | 3 . 3 ·                 | 10 18                   |\n| Transformer (big)               | 28.4   | 41.8   | 2 . 3 · 10              | 19                      |\n\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of P drop = 0 . 1 .\n\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵ ls = 0 . 1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n\n## 6 Results\n\n## 6.1 Machine Translation\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2 . 0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28 . 4 . The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3 . 5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41 . 0 , outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1 / 4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P drop = 0 . 1 , instead of 0 . 3 .\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0 . 6 [38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50 , but terminate early when possible [38].\n\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5 .\n\n## 6.2 Model Variations\n\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base model. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Listed perplexities are per-wordpiece, according to our byte-pair encoding, and should not be compared to per-word perplexities.\n\n|      | N                                             | d model   | d ff   | h   | d k   | d v   | P drop   | ϵ ls   | train steps   | PPL (dev)   | BLEU (dev)   | params × 10 6   |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----|-------|-------|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| base | 6                                             | 512       | 2048   | 8   | 64    | 64    | 0.1      | 0.1    | 100K          | 4.92        | 25.8         | 65              |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 1   | 512   | 512   |          |        |               | 5.29        | 24.9         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 4   | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 5.00        | 25.5         |                 |\n| (A)  |                                               |           |        | 16  | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 4.91        | 25.8         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 32  | 16    | 16    |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     | 16    |       |          |        |               | 5.16        | 25.1         | 58              |\n| (B)  |                                               |           |        |     | 32    |       |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         | 60              |\n| (C)  | 2                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 6.11        | 23.7         | 36              |\n|      | 4                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.19        | 25.3         | 50              |\n|      | 8                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.88        | 25.5         | 80              |\n|      | 256                                           |           |        |     | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 5.75        | 24.5         | 28              |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 4.66        | 26.0         | 168             |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.12        | 25.4         | 53              |\n|      | 4096                                          |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.75        | 26.2         | 90              |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.0      |        |               | 5.77        | 24.6         |                 |\n| (D)  |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.2      |        |               | 4.95        | 25.5         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       |          | 0.0    |               | 4.67        | 25.3         |                 |\n| (E)  | 0.2 positional embedding instead of sinusoids |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.47 4.92   | 25.7 25.7    |                 |\n| big  | 6                                             | 1024      | 4096   | 16  |       |       | 0.3      |        | 300K          | 4.33        | 26.4         | 213             |\n\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size d k hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\n\n## 6.3 English Constituency Parsing\n\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\n\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with d model = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\n\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\n\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\n\n| Parser                              | Training                 |   WSJ 23 F1 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| Vinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0 . 3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\n\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\n\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor .\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t -1 and the input for position t . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n## 2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n\n## 3 Model Architecture\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to a sequence of continuous representations z = ( z 1 , ..., z n ) . Given z , the decoder then generates an output sequence ( y 1 , ..., y m ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_1.png)\n\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\n\n## 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x +Sublayer( x )) , where Sublayer( x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512 .\n\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i .\n\n## 3.2 Attention\n\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n\n## Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_3.png)\n\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n\n## 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension d k , and values of dimension d v . We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √ d k , and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q . The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\nAttention( Q,K,V ) = softmax( QK T √ d k ) V (1)\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1 √ d k . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of d k the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d k [3]. We suspect that for large values of d k , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4 . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1 √ d k .\n\n## 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with d model-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d k , d k and d v dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d v -dimensional\n\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.\n\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n\nMultiHead( Q,K,V ) = Concat(head 1 , ..., head h ) W O where head = Attention( QW Q , KW K , V W V )\n\ni i i i\n\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q i ∈ R d model × d k , W K i ∈ R d model × d k , W V i ∈ R d model × d v and W O ∈ R hd v × d model .\n\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use d k = d v = d model /h = 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n## 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n- · In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\n- · The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n- · Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -∞ ) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n\n## 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\nFFN( x ) = max(0 , xW 1 + b 1 ) W 2 + b 2 (2)\n\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is d model = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality d ff = 2048 .\n\n## 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension d model. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √ d model.\n\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel size of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\n\n| Layer Type                  | Complexity per Layer   | Sequential Operations   | Maximum Path Length   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Self-Attention              | O ( n 2 · d )          | O (1)                   | O (1)                 |\n| Recurrent                   | O ( n · d 2 )          | O ( n )                 | O ( n )               |\n| Convolutional               | O ( k · n · d 2 )      | O (1)                   | O ( log k ( n ))      |\n| Self-Attention (restricted) | O ( r · n · d )        | O (1)                   | O ( n/r )             |\n\n## 3.5 Positional Encoding\n\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\nPE ( pos, 2 i ) = sin ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model ) PE ( pos, 2 i +1) = cos ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model )\n\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2 π to 10000 · 2 π . We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k , PE pos + k can be represented as a linear function of PE pos .\n\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\n\n## 4 Why Self-Attention\n\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to another sequence of equal length ( z 1 , ..., z n ) , with x i , z i ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O ( n ) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d , which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O ( n/r ) . We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O ( n/k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O ( log k ( n )) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k . Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O ( k · n · d + n · d 2 ) . Even with k = n , however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n\n## 5 Training\n\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n\n## 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\n\n## 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\n\n## 5.3 Optimizer\n\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β 1 = 0 . 9 , β 2 = 0 . 98 and ϵ = 10 -9 . We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\nlrate = d -0 . 5 model · min( step \\_ num -0 . 5 , step \\_ num · warmup \\_ steps -1 . 5 ) (3)\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup \\_ steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup \\_ steps = 4000 .\n\n## 5.4 Regularization\n\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\n\n| Model                           | BLEU   | BLEU   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                 | EN-DE  | EN-FR  | EN-DE                   | EN-FR                   |\n| ByteNet [18]                    | 23.75  |        |                         |                         |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk [39]          |        | 39.2   |                         | 1 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL [38]                  | 24.6   | 39.92  | 2 . 3 · 10 19           | 1 . 4 · 10 20           |\n| ConvS2S [9]                     | 25.16  | 40.46  | 9 . 6 · 10 18           | 1 . 5 · 10 20           |\n| MoE [32]                        | 26.03  | 40.56  | 2 . 0 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 20           |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] |        | 40.4   |                         | 8 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL Ensemble [38]         | 26.30  | 41.16  | 1 . 8 · 10 20           | 1 . 1 · 10 21           |\n| ConvS2S Ensemble [9]            | 26.36  | 41.29  | 7 . 7 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 21           |\n| Transformer (base model)        | 27.3   | 38.1   | 3 . 3 ·                 | 10 18                   |\n| Transformer (big)               | 28.4   | 41.8   | 2 . 3 · 10              | 19                      |\n\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of P drop = 0 . 1 .\n\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵ ls = 0 . 1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n\n## 6 Results\n\n## 6.1 Machine Translation\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2 . 0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28 . 4 . The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3 . 5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41 . 0 , outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1 / 4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P drop = 0 . 1 , instead of 0 . 3 .\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0 . 6 [38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50 , but terminate early when possible [38].\n\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5 .\n\n## 6.2 Model Variations\n\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base model. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Listed perplexities are per-wordpiece, according to our byte-pair encoding, and should not be compared to per-word perplexities.\n\n|      | N                                             | d model   | d ff   | h   | d k   | d v   | P drop   | ϵ ls   | train steps   | PPL (dev)   | BLEU (dev)   | params × 10 6   |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----|-------|-------|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| base | 6                                             | 512       | 2048   | 8   | 64    | 64    | 0.1      | 0.1    | 100K          | 4.92        | 25.8         | 65              |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 1   | 512   | 512   |          |        |               | 5.29        | 24.9         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 4   | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 5.00        | 25.5         |                 |\n| (A)  |                                               |           |        | 16  | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 4.91        | 25.8         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 32  | 16    | 16    |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     | 16    |       |          |        |               | 5.16        | 25.1         | 58              |\n| (B)  |                                               |           |        |     | 32    |       |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         | 60              |\n| (C)  | 2                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 6.11        | 23.7         | 36              |\n|      | 4                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.19        | 25.3         | 50              |\n|      | 8                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.88        | 25.5         | 80              |\n|      | 256                                           |           |        |     | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 5.75        | 24.5         | 28              |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 4.66        | 26.0         | 168             |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.12        | 25.4         | 53              |\n|      | 4096                                          |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.75        | 26.2         | 90              |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.0      |        |               | 5.77        | 24.6         |                 |\n| (D)  |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.2      |        |               | 4.95        | 25.5         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       |          | 0.0    |               | 4.67        | 25.3         |                 |\n| (E)  | 0.2 positional embedding instead of sinusoids |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.47 4.92   | 25.7 25.7    |                 |\n| big  | 6                                             | 1024      | 4096   | 16  |       |       | 0.3      |        | 300K          | 4.33        | 26.4         | 213             |\n\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size d k hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\n\n## 6.3 English Constituency Parsing\n\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\n\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with d model = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\n\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\n\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\n\n| Parser                              | Training                 |   WSJ 23 F1 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| Vinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0 . 3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\n\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\n\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor .\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t -1 and the input for position t . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n## 2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n\n## 3 Model Architecture\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to a sequence of continuous representations z = ( z 1 , ..., z n ) . Given z , the decoder then generates an output sequence ( y 1 , ..., y m ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_1.png)\n\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\n\n## 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x +Sublayer( x )) , where Sublayer( x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512 .\n\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i .\n\n## 3.2 Attention\n\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n\n## Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_3.png)\n\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n\n## 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension d k , and values of dimension d v . We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √ d k , and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q . The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\nAttention( Q,K,V ) = softmax( QK T √ d k ) V (1)\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1 √ d k . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of d k the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d k [3]. We suspect that for large values of d k , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4 . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1 √ d k .\n\n## 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with d model-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d k , d k and d v dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d v -dimensional\n\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.\n\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n\nMultiHead( Q,K,V ) = Concat(head 1 , ..., head h ) W O where head = Attention( QW Q , KW K , V W V )\n\ni i i i\n\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q i ∈ R d model × d k , W K i ∈ R d model × d k , W V i ∈ R d model × d v and W O ∈ R hd v × d model .\n\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use d k = d v = d model /h = 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n## 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n- · In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\n- · The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n- · Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -∞ ) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n\n## 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\nFFN( x ) = max(0 , xW 1 + b 1 ) W 2 + b 2 (2)\n\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is d model = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality d ff = 2048 .\n\n## 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension d model. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √ d model.\n\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel size of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\n\n| Layer Type                  | Complexity per Layer   | Sequential Operations   | Maximum Path Length   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Self-Attention              | O ( n 2 · d )          | O (1)                   | O (1)                 |\n| Recurrent                   | O ( n · d 2 )          | O ( n )                 | O ( n )               |\n| Convolutional               | O ( k · n · d 2 )      | O (1)                   | O ( log k ( n ))      |\n| Self-Attention (restricted) | O ( r · n · d )        | O (1)                   | O ( n/r )             |\n\n## 3.5 Positional Encoding\n\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\nPE ( pos, 2 i ) = sin ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model ) PE ( pos, 2 i +1) = cos ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model )\n\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2 π to 10000 · 2 π . We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k , PE pos + k can be represented as a linear function of PE pos .\n\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\n\n## 4 Why Self-Attention\n\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to another sequence of equal length ( z 1 , ..., z n ) , with x i , z i ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O ( n ) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d , which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O ( n/r ) . We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O ( n/k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O ( log k ( n )) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k . Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O ( k · n · d + n · d 2 ) . Even with k = n , however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n\n## 5 Training\n\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n\n## 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\n\n## 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\n\n## 5.3 Optimizer\n\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β 1 = 0 . 9 , β 2 = 0 . 98 and ϵ = 10 -9 . We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\nlrate = d -0 . 5 model · min( step \\_ num -0 . 5 , step \\_ num · warmup \\_ steps -1 . 5 ) (3)\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup \\_ steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup \\_ steps = 4000 .\n\n## 5.4 Regularization\n\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\n\n| Model                           | BLEU   | BLEU   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                 | EN-DE  | EN-FR  | EN-DE                   | EN-FR                   |\n| ByteNet [18]                    | 23.75  |        |                         |                         |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk [39]          |        | 39.2   |                         | 1 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL [38]                  | 24.6   | 39.92  | 2 . 3 · 10 19           | 1 . 4 · 10 20           |\n| ConvS2S [9]                     | 25.16  | 40.46  | 9 . 6 · 10 18           | 1 . 5 · 10 20           |\n| MoE [32]                        | 26.03  | 40.56  | 2 . 0 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 20           |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] |        | 40.4   |                         | 8 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL Ensemble [38]         | 26.30  | 41.16  | 1 . 8 · 10 20           | 1 . 1 · 10 21           |\n| ConvS2S Ensemble [9]            | 26.36  | 41.29  | 7 . 7 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 21           |\n| Transformer (base model)        | 27.3   | 38.1   | 3 . 3 ·                 | 10 18                   |\n| Transformer (big)               | 28.4   | 41.8   | 2 . 3 · 10              | 19                      |\n\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of P drop = 0 . 1 .\n\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵ ls = 0 . 1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n\n## 6 Results\n\n## 6.1 Machine Translation\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2 . 0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28 . 4 . The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3 . 5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41 . 0 , outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1 / 4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P drop = 0 . 1 , instead of 0 . 3 .\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0 . 6 [38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50 , but terminate early when possible [38].\n\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5 .\n\n## 6.2 Model Variations\n\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base model. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Listed perplexities are per-wordpiece, according to our byte-pair encoding, and should not be compared to per-word perplexities.\n\n|      | N                                             | d model   | d ff   | h   | d k   | d v   | P drop   | ϵ ls   | train steps   | PPL (dev)   | BLEU (dev)   | params × 10 6   |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----|-------|-------|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| base | 6                                             | 512       | 2048   | 8   | 64    | 64    | 0.1      | 0.1    | 100K          | 4.92        | 25.8         | 65              |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 1   | 512   | 512   |          |        |               | 5.29        | 24.9         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 4   | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 5.00        | 25.5         |                 |\n| (A)  |                                               |           |        | 16  | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 4.91        | 25.8         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 32  | 16    | 16    |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     | 16    |       |          |        |               | 5.16        | 25.1         | 58              |\n| (B)  |                                               |           |        |     | 32    |       |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         | 60              |\n| (C)  | 2                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 6.11        | 23.7         | 36              |\n|      | 4                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.19        | 25.3         | 50              |\n|      | 8                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.88        | 25.5         | 80              |\n|      | 256                                           |           |        |     | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 5.75        | 24.5         | 28              |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 4.66        | 26.0         | 168             |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.12        | 25.4         | 53              |\n|      | 4096                                          |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.75        | 26.2         | 90              |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.0      |        |               | 5.77        | 24.6         |                 |\n| (D)  |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.2      |        |               | 4.95        | 25.5         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       |          | 0.0    |               | 4.67        | 25.3         |                 |\n| (E)  | 0.2 positional embedding instead of sinusoids |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.47 4.92   | 25.7 25.7    |                 |\n| big  | 6                                             | 1024      | 4096   | 16  |       |       | 0.3      |        | 300K          | 4.33        | 26.4         | 213             |\n\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size d k hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\n\n## 6.3 English Constituency Parsing\n\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\n\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with d model = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\n\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\n\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\n\n| Parser                              | Training                 |   WSJ 23 F1 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| Vinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0 . 3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\n\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\n\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor .\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t -1 and the input for position t . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n## 2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n\n## 3 Model Architecture\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to a sequence of continuous representations z = ( z 1 , ..., z n ) . Given z , the decoder then generates an output sequence ( y 1 , ..., y m ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_1.png)\n\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\n\n## 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x +Sublayer( x )) , where Sublayer( x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512 .\n\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i .\n\n## 3.2 Attention\n\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n\n## Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_3.png)\n\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n\n## 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension d k , and values of dimension d v . We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √ d k , and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q . The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\nAttention( Q,K,V ) = softmax( QK T √ d k ) V (1)\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1 √ d k . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of d k the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d k [3]. We suspect that for large values of d k , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4 . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1 √ d k .\n\n## 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with d model-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d k , d k and d v dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d v -dimensional\n\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.\n\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n\nMultiHead( Q,K,V ) = Concat(head 1 , ..., head h ) W O where head = Attention( QW Q , KW K , V W V )\n\ni i i i\n\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q i ∈ R d model × d k , W K i ∈ R d model × d k , W V i ∈ R d model × d v and W O ∈ R hd v × d model .\n\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use d k = d v = d model /h = 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n## 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n- · In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\n- · The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n- · Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -∞ ) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n\n## 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\nFFN( x ) = max(0 , xW 1 + b 1 ) W 2 + b 2 (2)\n\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is d model = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality d ff = 2048 .\n\n## 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension d model. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √ d model.\n\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel size of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\n\n| Layer Type                  | Complexity per Layer   | Sequential Operations   | Maximum Path Length   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Self-Attention              | O ( n 2 · d )          | O (1)                   | O (1)                 |\n| Recurrent                   | O ( n · d 2 )          | O ( n )                 | O ( n )               |\n| Convolutional               | O ( k · n · d 2 )      | O (1)                   | O ( log k ( n ))      |\n| Self-Attention (restricted) | O ( r · n · d )        | O (1)                   | O ( n/r )             |\n\n## 3.5 Positional Encoding\n\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\nPE ( pos, 2 i ) = sin ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model ) PE ( pos, 2 i +1) = cos ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model )\n\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2 π to 10000 · 2 π . We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k , PE pos + k can be represented as a linear function of PE pos .\n\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\n\n## 4 Why Self-Attention\n\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to another sequence of equal length ( z 1 , ..., z n ) , with x i , z i ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O ( n ) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d , which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O ( n/r ) . We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O ( n/k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O ( log k ( n )) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k . Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O ( k · n · d + n · d 2 ) . Even with k = n , however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n\n## 5 Training\n\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n\n## 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\n\n## 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\n\n## 5.3 Optimizer\n\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β 1 = 0 . 9 , β 2 = 0 . 98 and ϵ = 10 -9 . We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\nlrate = d -0 . 5 model · min( step \\_ num -0 . 5 , step \\_ num · warmup \\_ steps -1 . 5 ) (3)\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup \\_ steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup \\_ steps = 4000 .\n\n## 5.4 Regularization\n\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\n\n| Model                           | BLEU   | BLEU   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                 | EN-DE  | EN-FR  | EN-DE                   | EN-FR                   |\n| ByteNet [18]                    | 23.75  |        |                         |                         |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk [39]          |        | 39.2   |                         | 1 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL [38]                  | 24.6   | 39.92  | 2 . 3 · 10 19           | 1 . 4 · 10 20           |\n| ConvS2S [9]                     | 25.16  | 40.46  | 9 . 6 · 10 18           | 1 . 5 · 10 20           |\n| MoE [32]                        | 26.03  | 40.56  | 2 . 0 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 20           |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] |        | 40.4   |                         | 8 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL Ensemble [38]         | 26.30  | 41.16  | 1 . 8 · 10 20           | 1 . 1 · 10 21           |\n| ConvS2S Ensemble [9]            | 26.36  | 41.29  | 7 . 7 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 21           |\n| Transformer (base model)        | 27.3   | 38.1   | 3 . 3 ·                 | 10 18                   |\n| Transformer (big)               | 28.4   | 41.8   | 2 . 3 · 10              | 19                      |\n\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of P drop = 0 . 1 .\n\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵ ls = 0 . 1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n\n## 6 Results\n\n## 6.1 Machine Translation\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2 . 0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28 . 4 . The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3 . 5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41 . 0 , outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1 / 4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P drop = 0 . 1 , instead of 0 . 3 .\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0 . 6 [38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50 , but terminate early when possible [38].\n\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5 .\n\n## 6.2 Model Variations\n\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base model. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Listed perplexities are per-wordpiece, according to our byte-pair encoding, and should not be compared to per-word perplexities.\n\n|      | N                                             | d model   | d ff   | h   | d k   | d v   | P drop   | ϵ ls   | train steps   | PPL (dev)   | BLEU (dev)   | params × 10 6   |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----|-------|-------|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| base | 6                                             | 512       | 2048   | 8   | 64    | 64    | 0.1      | 0.1    | 100K          | 4.92        | 25.8         | 65              |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 1   | 512   | 512   |          |        |               | 5.29        | 24.9         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 4   | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 5.00        | 25.5         |                 |\n| (A)  |                                               |           |        | 16  | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 4.91        | 25.8         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 32  | 16    | 16    |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     | 16    |       |          |        |               | 5.16        | 25.1         | 58              |\n| (B)  |                                               |           |        |     | 32    |       |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         | 60              |\n| (C)  | 2                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 6.11        | 23.7         | 36              |\n|      | 4                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.19        | 25.3         | 50              |\n|      | 8                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.88        | 25.5         | 80              |\n|      | 256                                           |           |        |     | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 5.75        | 24.5         | 28              |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 4.66        | 26.0         | 168             |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.12        | 25.4         | 53              |\n|      | 4096                                          |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.75        | 26.2         | 90              |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.0      |        |               | 5.77        | 24.6         |                 |\n| (D)  |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.2      |        |               | 4.95        | 25.5         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       |          | 0.0    |               | 4.67        | 25.3         |                 |\n| (E)  | 0.2 positional embedding instead of sinusoids |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.47 4.92   | 25.7 25.7    |                 |\n| big  | 6                                             | 1024      | 4096   | 16  |       |       | 0.3      |        | 300K          | 4.33        | 26.4         | 213             |\n\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size d k hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\n\n## 6.3 English Constituency Parsing\n\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\n\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with d model = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\n\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\n\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\n\n| Parser                              | Training                 |   WSJ 23 F1 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| Vinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0 . 3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\n\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\n\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor .\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t -1 and the input for position t . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n## 2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n\n## 3 Model Architecture\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to a sequence of continuous representations z = ( z 1 , ..., z n ) . Given z , the decoder then generates an output sequence ( y 1 , ..., y m ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_1.png)\n\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\n\n## 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x +Sublayer( x )) , where Sublayer( x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512 .\n\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i .\n\n## 3.2 Attention\n\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n\n## Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_3.png)\n\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n\n## 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension d k , and values of dimension d v . We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √ d k , and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q . The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\nAttention( Q,K,V ) = softmax( QK T √ d k ) V (1)\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1 √ d k . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of d k the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d k [3]. We suspect that for large values of d k , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4 . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1 √ d k .\n\n## 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with d model-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d k , d k and d v dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d v -dimensional\n\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.\n\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n\nMultiHead( Q,K,V ) = Concat(head 1 , ..., head h ) W O where head = Attention( QW Q , KW K , V W V )\n\ni i i i\n\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q i ∈ R d model × d k , W K i ∈ R d model × d k , W V i ∈ R d model × d v and W O ∈ R hd v × d model .\n\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use d k = d v = d model /h = 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n## 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n- · In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\n- · The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n- · Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -∞ ) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n\n## 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\nFFN( x ) = max(0 , xW 1 + b 1 ) W 2 + b 2 (2)\n\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is d model = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality d ff = 2048 .\n\n## 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension d model. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √ d model.\n\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel size of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\n\n| Layer Type                  | Complexity per Layer   | Sequential Operations   | Maximum Path Length   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Self-Attention              | O ( n 2 · d )          | O (1)                   | O (1)                 |\n| Recurrent                   | O ( n · d 2 )          | O ( n )                 | O ( n )               |\n| Convolutional               | O ( k · n · d 2 )      | O (1)                   | O ( log k ( n ))      |\n| Self-Attention (restricted) | O ( r · n · d )        | O (1)                   | O ( n/r )             |\n\n## 3.5 Positional Encoding\n\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\nPE ( pos, 2 i ) = sin ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model ) PE ( pos, 2 i +1) = cos ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model )\n\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2 π to 10000 · 2 π . We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k , PE pos + k can be represented as a linear function of PE pos .\n\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\n\n## 4 Why Self-Attention\n\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to another sequence of equal length ( z 1 , ..., z n ) , with x i , z i ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O ( n ) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d , which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O ( n/r ) . We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O ( n/k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O ( log k ( n )) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k . Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O ( k · n · d + n · d 2 ) . Even with k = n , however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n\n## 5 Training\n\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n\n## 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\n\n## 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\n\n## 5.3 Optimizer\n\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β 1 = 0 . 9 , β 2 = 0 . 98 and ϵ = 10 -9 . We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\nlrate = d -0 . 5 model · min( step \\_ num -0 . 5 , step \\_ num · warmup \\_ steps -1 . 5 ) (3)\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup \\_ steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup \\_ steps = 4000 .\n\n## 5.4 Regularization\n\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\n\n| Model                           | BLEU   | BLEU   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                 | EN-DE  | EN-FR  | EN-DE                   | EN-FR                   |\n| ByteNet [18]                    | 23.75  |        |                         |                         |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk [39]          |        | 39.2   |                         | 1 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL [38]                  | 24.6   | 39.92  | 2 . 3 · 10 19           | 1 . 4 · 10 20           |\n| ConvS2S [9]                     | 25.16  | 40.46  | 9 . 6 · 10 18           | 1 . 5 · 10 20           |\n| MoE [32]                        | 26.03  | 40.56  | 2 . 0 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 20           |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] |        | 40.4   |                         | 8 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL Ensemble [38]         | 26.30  | 41.16  | 1 . 8 · 10 20           | 1 . 1 · 10 21           |\n| ConvS2S Ensemble [9]            | 26.36  | 41.29  | 7 . 7 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 21           |\n| Transformer (base model)        | 27.3   | 38.1   | 3 . 3 ·                 | 10 18                   |\n| Transformer (big)               | 28.4   | 41.8   | 2 . 3 · 10              | 19                      |\n\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of P drop = 0 . 1 .\n\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵ ls = 0 . 1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n\n## 6 Results\n\n## 6.1 Machine Translation\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2 . 0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28 . 4 . The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3 . 5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41 . 0 , outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1 / 4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P drop = 0 . 1 , instead of 0 . 3 .\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0 . 6 [38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50 , but terminate early when possible [38].\n\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5 .\n\n## 6.2 Model Variations\n\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base model. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Listed perplexities are per-wordpiece, according to our byte-pair encoding, and should not be compared to per-word perplexities.\n\n|      | N                                             | d model   | d ff   | h   | d k   | d v   | P drop   | ϵ ls   | train steps   | PPL (dev)   | BLEU (dev)   | params × 10 6   |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----|-------|-------|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| base | 6                                             | 512       | 2048   | 8   | 64    | 64    | 0.1      | 0.1    | 100K          | 4.92        | 25.8         | 65              |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 1   | 512   | 512   |          |        |               | 5.29        | 24.9         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 4   | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 5.00        | 25.5         |                 |\n| (A)  |                                               |           |        | 16  | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 4.91        | 25.8         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 32  | 16    | 16    |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     | 16    |       |          |        |               | 5.16        | 25.1         | 58              |\n| (B)  |                                               |           |        |     | 32    |       |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         | 60              |\n| (C)  | 2                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 6.11        | 23.7         | 36              |\n|      | 4                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.19        | 25.3         | 50              |\n|      | 8                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.88        | 25.5         | 80              |\n|      | 256                                           |           |        |     | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 5.75        | 24.5         | 28              |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 4.66        | 26.0         | 168             |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.12        | 25.4         | 53              |\n|      | 4096                                          |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.75        | 26.2         | 90              |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.0      |        |               | 5.77        | 24.6         |                 |\n| (D)  |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.2      |        |               | 4.95        | 25.5         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       |          | 0.0    |               | 4.67        | 25.3         |                 |\n| (E)  | 0.2 positional embedding instead of sinusoids |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.47 4.92   | 25.7 25.7    |                 |\n| big  | 6                                             | 1024      | 4096   | 16  |       |       | 0.3      |        | 300K          | 4.33        | 26.4         | 213             |\n\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size d k hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\n\n## 6.3 English Constituency Parsing\n\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\n\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with d model = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\n\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\n\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\n\n| Parser                              | Training                 |   WSJ 23 F1 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| Vinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0 . 3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\n\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\n\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor .\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t -1 and the input for position t . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n## 2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n\n## 3 Model Architecture\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to a sequence of continuous representations z = ( z 1 , ..., z n ) . Given z , the decoder then generates an output sequence ( y 1 , ..., y m ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_1.png)\n\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\n\n## 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x +Sublayer( x )) , where Sublayer( x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512 .\n\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i .\n\n## 3.2 Attention\n\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n\n## Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_3.png)\n\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n\n## 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension d k , and values of dimension d v . We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √ d k , and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q . The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\nAttention( Q,K,V ) = softmax( QK T √ d k ) V (1)\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1 √ d k . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of d k the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d k [3]. We suspect that for large values of d k , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4 . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1 √ d k .\n\n## 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with d model-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d k , d k and d v dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d v -dimensional\n\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.\n\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n\nMultiHead( Q,K,V ) = Concat(head 1 , ..., head h ) W O where head = Attention( QW Q , KW K , V W V )\n\ni i i i\n\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q i ∈ R d model × d k , W K i ∈ R d model × d k , W V i ∈ R d model × d v and W O ∈ R hd v × d model .\n\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use d k = d v = d model /h = 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n## 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n- · In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\n- · The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n- · Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -∞ ) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n\n## 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\nFFN( x ) = max(0 , xW 1 + b 1 ) W 2 + b 2 (2)\n\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is d model = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality d ff = 2048 .\n\n## 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension d model. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √ d model.\n\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel size of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\n\n| Layer Type                  | Complexity per Layer   | Sequential Operations   | Maximum Path Length   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Self-Attention              | O ( n 2 · d )          | O (1)                   | O (1)                 |\n| Recurrent                   | O ( n · d 2 )          | O ( n )                 | O ( n )               |\n| Convolutional               | O ( k · n · d 2 )      | O (1)                   | O ( log k ( n ))      |\n| Self-Attention (restricted) | O ( r · n · d )        | O (1)                   | O ( n/r )             |\n\n## 3.5 Positional Encoding\n\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\nPE ( pos, 2 i ) = sin ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model ) PE ( pos, 2 i +1) = cos ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model )\n\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2 π to 10000 · 2 π . We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k , PE pos + k can be represented as a linear function of PE pos .\n\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\n\n## 4 Why Self-Attention\n\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to another sequence of equal length ( z 1 , ..., z n ) , with x i , z i ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O ( n ) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d , which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O ( n/r ) . We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O ( n/k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O ( log k ( n )) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k . Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O ( k · n · d + n · d 2 ) . Even with k = n , however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n\n## 5 Training\n\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n\n## 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\n\n## 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\n\n## 5.3 Optimizer\n\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β 1 = 0 . 9 , β 2 = 0 . 98 and ϵ = 10 -9 . We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\nlrate = d -0 . 5 model · min( step \\_ num -0 . 5 , step \\_ num · warmup \\_ steps -1 . 5 ) (3)\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup \\_ steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup \\_ steps = 4000 .\n\n## 5.4 Regularization\n\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\n\n| Model                           | BLEU   | BLEU   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                 | EN-DE  | EN-FR  | EN-DE                   | EN-FR                   |\n| ByteNet [18]                    | 23.75  |        |                         |                         |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk [39]          |        | 39.2   |                         | 1 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL [38]                  | 24.6   | 39.92  | 2 . 3 · 10 19           | 1 . 4 · 10 20           |\n| ConvS2S [9]                     | 25.16  | 40.46  | 9 . 6 · 10 18           | 1 . 5 · 10 20           |\n| MoE [32]                        | 26.03  | 40.56  | 2 . 0 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 20           |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] |        | 40.4   |                         | 8 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL Ensemble [38]         | 26.30  | 41.16  | 1 . 8 · 10 20           | 1 . 1 · 10 21           |\n| ConvS2S Ensemble [9]            | 26.36  | 41.29  | 7 . 7 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 21           |\n| Transformer (base model)        | 27.3   | 38.1   | 3 . 3 ·                 | 10 18                   |\n| Transformer (big)               | 28.4   | 41.8   | 2 . 3 · 10              | 19                      |\n\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of P drop = 0 . 1 .\n\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵ ls = 0 . 1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n\n## 6 Results\n\n## 6.1 Machine Translation\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2 . 0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28 . 4 . The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3 . 5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41 . 0 , outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1 / 4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P drop = 0 . 1 , instead of 0 . 3 .\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0 . 6 [38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50 , but terminate early when possible [38].\n\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5 .\n\n## 6.2 Model Variations\n\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base model. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Listed perplexities are per-wordpiece, according to our byte-pair encoding, and should not be compared to per-word perplexities.\n\n|      | N                                             | d model   | d ff   | h   | d k   | d v   | P drop   | ϵ ls   | train steps   | PPL (dev)   | BLEU (dev)   | params × 10 6   |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----|-------|-------|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| base | 6                                             | 512       | 2048   | 8   | 64    | 64    | 0.1      | 0.1    | 100K          | 4.92        | 25.8         | 65              |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 1   | 512   | 512   |          |        |               | 5.29        | 24.9         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 4   | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 5.00        | 25.5         |                 |\n| (A)  |                                               |           |        | 16  | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 4.91        | 25.8         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 32  | 16    | 16    |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     | 16    |       |          |        |               | 5.16        | 25.1         | 58              |\n| (B)  |                                               |           |        |     | 32    |       |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         | 60              |\n| (C)  | 2                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 6.11        | 23.7         | 36              |\n|      | 4                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.19        | 25.3         | 50              |\n|      | 8                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.88        | 25.5         | 80              |\n|      | 256                                           |           |        |     | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 5.75        | 24.5         | 28              |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 4.66        | 26.0         | 168             |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.12        | 25.4         | 53              |\n|      | 4096                                          |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.75        | 26.2         | 90              |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.0      |        |               | 5.77        | 24.6         |                 |\n| (D)  |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.2      |        |               | 4.95        | 25.5         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       |          | 0.0    |               | 4.67        | 25.3         |                 |\n| (E)  | 0.2 positional embedding instead of sinusoids |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.47 4.92   | 25.7 25.7    |                 |\n| big  | 6                                             | 1024      | 4096   | 16  |       |       | 0.3      |        | 300K          | 4.33        | 26.4         | 213             |\n\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size d k hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\n\n## 6.3 English Constituency Parsing\n\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\n\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with d model = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\n\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\n\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\n\n| Parser                              | Training                 |   WSJ 23 F1 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| Vinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0 . 3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\n\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\n\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor .\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Many of the attention heads attend to a distant dependency of the verb 'making', completing the phrase 'making...more difficult'. Attentions here shown only for the word 'making'. Different colors represent different heads. Best viewed in color.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_4.png)\n\nInput-Input Layer5\n\nFigure 4: Two attention heads, also in layer 5 of 6, apparently involved in anaphora resolution. Top: Full attentions for head 5. Bottom: Isolated attentions from just the word 'its' for attention heads 5 and 6. Note that the attentions are very sharp for this word.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_5.png)\n\nInput-Input Layer5\n\nFigure 5: Many of the attention heads exhibit behaviour that seems related to the structure of the sentence. We give two such examples above, from two different heads from the encoder self-attention at layer 5 of 6. The heads clearly learned to perform different tasks.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_6.png)\nIf the question isn't related to the provided documents, politely inform the user that you can only answer questions about the selected documents."

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t -1 and the input for position t . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n## 2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n\n## 3 Model Architecture\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to a sequence of continuous representations z = ( z 1 , ..., z n ) . Given z , the decoder then generates an output sequence ( y 1 , ..., y m ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_1.png)\n\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\n\n## 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x +Sublayer( x )) , where Sublayer( x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512 .\n\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i .\n\n## 3.2 Attention\n\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n\n## Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_3.png)\n\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n\n## 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension d k , and values of dimension d v . We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √ d k , and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q . The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\nAttention( Q,K,V ) = softmax( QK T √ d k ) V (1)\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1 √ d k . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of d k the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d k [3]. We suspect that for large values of d k , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4 . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1 √ d k .\n\n## 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with d model-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d k , d k and d v dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d v -dimensional\n\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.\n\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n\nMultiHead( Q,K,V ) = Concat(head 1 , ..., head h ) W O where head = Attention( QW Q , KW K , V W V )\n\ni i i i\n\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q i ∈ R d model × d k , W K i ∈ R d model × d k , W V i ∈ R d model × d v and W O ∈ R hd v × d model .\n\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use d k = d v = d model /h = 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n## 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n- · In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\n- · The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n- · Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -∞ ) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n\n## 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\nFFN( x ) = max(0 , xW 1 + b 1 ) W 2 + b 2 (2)\n\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is d model = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality d ff = 2048 .\n\n## 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension d model. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √ d model.\n\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel size of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\n\n| Layer Type                  | Complexity per Layer   | Sequential Operations   | Maximum Path Length   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Self-Attention              | O ( n 2 · d )          | O (1)                   | O (1)                 |\n| Recurrent                   | O ( n · d 2 )          | O ( n )                 | O ( n )               |\n| Convolutional               | O ( k · n · d 2 )      | O (1)                   | O ( log k ( n ))      |\n| Self-Attention (restricted) | O ( r · n · d )        | O (1)                   | O ( n/r )             |\n\n## 3.5 Positional Encoding\n\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\nPE ( pos, 2 i ) = sin ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model ) PE ( pos, 2 i +1) = cos ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model )\n\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2 π to 10000 · 2 π . We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k , PE pos + k can be represented as a linear function of PE pos .\n\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\n\n## 4 Why Self-Attention\n\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to another sequence of equal length ( z 1 , ..., z n ) , with x i , z i ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O ( n ) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d , which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O ( n/r ) . We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O ( n/k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O ( log k ( n )) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k . Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O ( k · n · d + n · d 2 ) . Even with k = n , however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n\n## 5 Training\n\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n\n## 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\n\n## 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\n\n## 5.3 Optimizer\n\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β 1 = 0 . 9 , β 2 = 0 . 98 and ϵ = 10 -9 . We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\nlrate = d -0 . 5 model · min( step \\_ num -0 . 5 , step \\_ num · warmup \\_ steps -1 . 5 ) (3)\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup \\_ steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup \\_ steps = 4000 .\n\n## 5.4 Regularization\n\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\n\n| Model                           | BLEU   | BLEU   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                 | EN-DE  | EN-FR  | EN-DE                   | EN-FR                   |\n| ByteNet [18]                    | 23.75  |        |                         |                         |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk [39]          |        | 39.2   |                         | 1 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL [38]                  | 24.6   | 39.92  | 2 . 3 · 10 19           | 1 . 4 · 10 20           |\n| ConvS2S [9]                     | 25.16  | 40.46  | 9 . 6 · 10 18           | 1 . 5 · 10 20           |\n| MoE [32]                        | 26.03  | 40.56  | 2 . 0 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 20           |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] |        | 40.4   |                         | 8 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL Ensemble [38]         | 26.30  | 41.16  | 1 . 8 · 10 20           | 1 . 1 · 10 21           |\n| ConvS2S Ensemble [9]            | 26.36  | 41.29  | 7 . 7 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 21           |\n| Transformer (base model)        | 27.3   | 38.1   | 3 . 3 ·                 | 10 18                   |\n| Transformer (big)               | 28.4   | 41.8   | 2 . 3 · 10              | 19                      |\n\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of P drop = 0 . 1 .\n\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵ ls = 0 . 1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n\n## 6 Results\n\n## 6.1 Machine Translation\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2 . 0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28 . 4 . The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3 . 5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41 . 0 , outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1 / 4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P drop = 0 . 1 , instead of 0 . 3 .\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0 . 6 [38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50 , but terminate early when possible [38].\n\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5 .\n\n## 6.2 Model Variations\n\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base model. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Listed perplexities are per-wordpiece, according to our byte-pair encoding, and should not be compared to per-word perplexities.\n\n|      | N                                             | d model   | d ff   | h   | d k   | d v   | P drop   | ϵ ls   | train steps   | PPL (dev)   | BLEU (dev)   | params × 10 6   |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----|-------|-------|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| base | 6                                             | 512       | 2048   | 8   | 64    | 64    | 0.1      | 0.1    | 100K          | 4.92        | 25.8         | 65              |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 1   | 512   | 512   |          |        |               | 5.29        | 24.9         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 4   | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 5.00        | 25.5         |                 |\n| (A)  |                                               |           |        | 16  | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 4.91        | 25.8         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 32  | 16    | 16    |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     | 16    |       |          |        |               | 5.16        | 25.1         | 58              |\n| (B)  |                                               |           |        |     | 32    |       |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         | 60              |\n| (C)  | 2                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 6.11        | 23.7         | 36              |\n|      | 4                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.19        | 25.3         | 50              |\n|      | 8                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.88        | 25.5         | 80              |\n|      | 256                                           |           |        |     | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 5.75        | 24.5         | 28              |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 4.66        | 26.0         | 168             |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.12        | 25.4         | 53              |\n|      | 4096                                          |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.75        | 26.2         | 90              |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.0      |        |               | 5.77        | 24.6         |                 |\n| (D)  |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.2      |        |               | 4.95        | 25.5         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       |          | 0.0    |               | 4.67        | 25.3         |                 |\n| (E)  | 0.2 positional embedding instead of sinusoids |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.47 4.92   | 25.7 25.7    |                 |\n| big  | 6                                             | 1024      | 4096   | 16  |       |       | 0.3      |        | 300K          | 4.33        | 26.4         | 213             |\n\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size d k hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\n\n## 6.3 English Constituency Parsing\n\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\n\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with d model = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\n\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\n\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\n\n| Parser                              | Training                 |   WSJ 23 F1 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| Vinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0 . 3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\n\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\n\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor .\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Many of the attention heads attend to a distant dependency of the verb 'making', completing the phrase 'making...more difficult'. Attentions here shown only for the word 'making'. Different colors represent different heads. Best viewed in color.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_4.png)\n\nInput-Input Layer5\n\nFigure 4: Two attention heads, also in layer 5 of 6, apparently involved in anaphora resolution. Top: Full attentions for head 5. Bottom: Isolated attentions from just the word 'its' for attention heads 5 and 6. Note that the attentions are very sharp for this word.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_5.png)\n\nInput-Input Layer5\n\nFigure 5: Many of the attention heads exhibit behaviour that seems related to the structure of the sentence. We give two such examples above, from two different heads from the encoder self-attention at layer 5 of 6. The heads clearly learned to perform different tasks.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_6.png)"

It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the  list  being  primarily  based  on  the  ISO  standard  ISO  3166-1.  For  instance,  the  United  Kingdom  is considered  a  single  entity,  while  the  constituent  countries  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.119 billion as of 2024. [1]\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/CountrywisePopulationpdf/images/tmp93w2kbp__image_2.png)\n\n## Method\n\nFigures  used  in  this  chart  are  based  on  the  most  up-to-date  estimates  or  projections  by  the  national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2024 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\nBecause  the  compiled  figures  are  not  collected  at  the  same  time  in  every  country,  or  at  the  same  level  of  accuracy,  the  resulting  numerical  comparisons  may  create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union, [a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica. [2]\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n|     | Location                         | Population    | % of world   | Date        | Source

The European Union is a sui generis supranational union whose sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has 5.49% of the world's population - see \"Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface TGM table\" (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps0000 1/default/table?lang=en). European Commission.\n- b. According to UN estimates, India surpassed China by the end of April 2023. [4]\n- c. Refers to Mainland China; excludes China's special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\n- d. Includes the population of the India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.\n- e. Includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but excludes the territories of the United States.\n- f. Includes the population of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and GilgitBaltistan.\n- g. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics has a projection of 181 million for 2025, but this method derives from a base year of 2011. This same projection overcounted the population for 2022 by about 4.4 million. [13]\n- h. Includes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, administrative areas on the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia. The population does not include the four annexed Ukrainian oblasts. The Ukrainian government and most of the world's other states consider the Crimean Peninsula, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia parts of Ukraine's territory.\n- i. Includes the integral 18 regions of France (including 5 overseas departments and regions). Excludes France's 5 overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna, and the sui generis collectivity of New Caledonia, which are shown separately. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff) and Clipperton Island (an uninhabited state private property of France) are not listed at all due to their extraordinary nature.\n- j. Excludes the three British Crown Dependencies and the 14 British Overseas Territories, listed separately. Four British Overseas Territories are not listed due to their extraordinary nature. The four not listed are British Antarctic Territory (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff), the British Indian Ocean Territory (a military base), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (hosts only government officials and research station staff), and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (a military base where permanent residency is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus).\n- k. Includes Zanzibar.\n- l. Does not include the Rohingya people. Some regions were estimated by satellite. [34]\n- m. Includes the regions Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra and Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab, the disputed territory of Western Sahara administered by Morocco and excluding Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (see Western Sahara conflict).\n- n. Despite high reported precision, estimates vary widely. For 2024, the CIA gives an estimate of 40,121,552 [47] , while the UN gives an estimate of 42,045,000 [48] , based on the 1979 census and fertility, mortality and immigration estimates. [49] Official figure includes an estimated 1.5 million nomadic population.\n- o. Excludes the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine's de jure territory which is occupied by Russia (however, includes the Donbas region, partly occupied by Russia).\n- p. Excludes the external territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island."

It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the  list  being  primarily  based  on  the  ISO  standard  ISO  3166-1.  For  instance,  the  United  Kingdom  is considered  a  single  entity,  while  the  constituent  countries  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.119 billion as of 2024. [1]\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/CountrywisePopulationpdf/images/tmp93w2kbp__image_2.png)\n\n## Method\n\nFigures  used  in  this  chart  are  based  on  the  most  up-to-date  estimates  or  projections  by  the  national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2024 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\nBecause  the  compiled  figures  are  not  collected  at  the  same  time  in  every  country,  or  at  the  same  level  of  accuracy,  the  resulting  numerical  comparisons  may  create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union, [a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica. [2]\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n|     | Location                         | Population    | % of world   | Date        | Source

The European Union is a sui generis supranational union whose sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has 5.49% of the world's population - see \"Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface TGM table\" (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps0000 1/default/table?lang=en). European Commission.\n- b. According to UN estimates, India surpassed China by the end of April 2023. [4]\n- c. Refers to Mainland China; excludes China's special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\n- d. Includes the population of the India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.\n- e. Includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but excludes the territories of the United States.\n- f. Includes the population of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and GilgitBaltistan.\n- g. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics has a projection of 181 million for 2025, but this method derives from a base year of 2011. This same projection overcounted the population for 2022 by about 4.4 million. [13]\n- h. Includes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, administrative areas on the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia. The population does not include the four annexed Ukrainian oblasts. The Ukrainian government and most of the world's other states consider the Crimean Peninsula, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia parts of Ukraine's territory.\n- i. Includes the integral 18 regions of France (including 5 overseas departments and regions). Excludes France's 5 overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna, and the sui generis collectivity of New Caledonia, which are shown separately. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff) and Clipperton Island (an uninhabited state private property of France) are not listed at all due to their extraordinary nature.\n- j. Excludes the three British Crown Dependencies and the 14 British Overseas Territories, listed separately. Four British Overseas Territories are not listed due to their extraordinary nature. The four not listed are British Antarctic Territory (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff), the British Indian Ocean Territory (a military base), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (hosts only government officials and research station staff), and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (a military base where permanent residency is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus).\n- k. Includes Zanzibar.\n- l. Does not include the Rohingya people. Some regions were estimated by satellite. [34]\n- m. Includes the regions Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra and Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab, the disputed territory of Western Sahara administered by Morocco and excluding Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (see Western Sahara conflict).\n- n. Despite high reported precision, estimates vary widely. For 2024, the CIA gives an estimate of 40,121,552 [47] , while the UN gives an estimate of 42,045,000 [48] , based on the 1979 census and fertility, mortality and immigration estimates. [49] Official figure includes an estimated 1.5 million nomadic population.\n- o. Excludes the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine's de jure territory which is occupied by Russia (however, includes the Donbas region, partly occupied by Russia).\n- p. Excludes the external territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island."

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t -1 and the input for position t . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n## 2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n\n## 3 Model Architecture\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to a sequence of continuous representations z = ( z 1 , ..., z n ) . Given z , the decoder then generates an output sequence ( y 1 , ..., y m ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_1.png)\n\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\n\n## 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x +Sublayer( x )) , where Sublayer( x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512 .\n\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i .\n\n## 3.2 Attention\n\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n\n## Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_3.png)\n\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n\n## 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension d k , and values of dimension d v . We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √ d k , and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q . The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\nAttention( Q,K,V ) = softmax( QK T √ d k ) V (1)\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1 √ d k . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of d k the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d k [3]. We suspect that for large values of d k , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4 . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1 √ d k .\n\n## 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with d model-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d k , d k and d v dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d v -dimensional\n\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.\n\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n\nMultiHead( Q,K,V ) = Concat(head 1 , ..., head h ) W O where head = Attention( QW Q , KW K , V W V )\n\ni i i i\n\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q i ∈ R d model × d k , W K i ∈ R d model × d k , W V i ∈ R d model × d v and W O ∈ R hd v × d model .\n\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use d k = d v = d model /h = 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n## 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n- · In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\n- · The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n- · Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -∞ ) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n\n## 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\nFFN( x ) = max(0 , xW 1 + b 1 ) W 2 + b 2 (2)\n\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is d model = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality d ff = 2048 .\n\n## 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension d model. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √ d model.\n\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel size of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\n\n| Layer Type                  | Complexity per Layer   | Sequential Operations   | Maximum Path Length   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Self-Attention              | O ( n 2 · d )          | O (1)                   | O (1)                 |\n| Recurrent                   | O ( n · d 2 )          | O ( n )                 | O ( n )               |\n| Convolutional               | O ( k · n · d 2 )      | O (1)                   | O ( log k ( n ))      |\n| Self-Attention (restricted) | O ( r · n · d )        | O (1)                   | O ( n/r )             |\n\n## 3.5 Positional Encoding\n\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\nPE ( pos, 2 i ) = sin ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model ) PE ( pos, 2 i +1) = cos ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model )\n\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2 π to 10000 · 2 π . We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k , PE pos + k can be represented as a linear function of PE pos .\n\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\n\n## 4 Why Self-Attention\n\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to another sequence of equal length ( z 1 , ..., z n ) , with x i , z i ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O ( n ) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d , which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O ( n/r ) . We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O ( n/k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O ( log k ( n )) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k . Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O ( k · n · d + n · d 2 ) . Even with k = n , however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n\n## 5 Training\n\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n\n## 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\n\n## 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\n\n## 5.3 Optimizer\n\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β 1 = 0 . 9 , β 2 = 0 . 98 and ϵ = 10 -9 . We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\nlrate = d -0 . 5 model · min( step \\_ num -0 . 5 , step \\_ num · warmup \\_ steps -1 . 5 ) (3)\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup \\_ steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup \\_ steps = 4000 .\n\n## 5.4 Regularization\n\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\n\n| Model                           | BLEU   | BLEU   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                 | EN-DE  | EN-FR  | EN-DE                   | EN-FR                   |\n| ByteNet [18]                    | 23.75  |        |                         |                         |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk [39]          |        | 39.2   |                         | 1 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL [38]                  | 24.6   | 39.92  | 2 . 3 · 10 19           | 1 . 4 · 10 20           |\n| ConvS2S [9]                     | 25.16  | 40.46  | 9 . 6 · 10 18           | 1 . 5 · 10 20           |\n| MoE [32]                        | 26.03  | 40.56  | 2 . 0 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 20           |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] |        | 40.4   |                         | 8 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL Ensemble [38]         | 26.30  | 41.16  | 1 . 8 · 10 20           | 1 . 1 · 10 21           |\n| ConvS2S Ensemble [9]            | 26.36  | 41.29  | 7 . 7 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 21           |\n| Transformer (base model)        | 27.3   | 38.1   | 3 . 3 ·                 | 10 18                   |\n| Transformer (big)               | 28.4   | 41.8   | 2 . 3 · 10              | 19                      |\n\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of P drop = 0 . 1 .\n\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵ ls = 0 . 1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n\n## 6 Results\n\n## 6.1 Machine Translation\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2 . 0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28 . 4 . The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3 . 5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41 . 0 , outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1 / 4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P drop = 0 . 1 , instead of 0 . 3 .\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0 . 6 [38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50 , but terminate early when possible [38].\n\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5 .\n\n## 6.2 Model Variations\n\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base model. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Listed perplexities are per-wordpiece, according to our byte-pair encoding, and should not be compared to per-word perplexities.\n\n|      | N                                             | d model   | d ff   | h   | d k   | d v   | P drop   | ϵ ls   | train steps   | PPL (dev)   | BLEU (dev)   | params × 10 6   |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----|-------|-------|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| base | 6                                             | 512       | 2048   | 8   | 64    | 64    | 0.1      | 0.1    | 100K          | 4.92        | 25.8         | 65              |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 1   | 512   | 512   |          |        |               | 5.29        | 24.9         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 4   | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 5.00        | 25.5         |                 |\n| (A)  |                                               |           |        | 16  | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 4.91        | 25.8         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 32  | 16    | 16    |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     | 16    |       |          |        |               | 5.16        | 25.1         | 58              |\n| (B)  |                                               |           |        |     | 32    |       |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         | 60              |\n| (C)  | 2                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 6.11        | 23.7         | 36              |\n|      | 4                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.19        | 25.3         | 50              |\n|      | 8                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.88        | 25.5         | 80              |\n|      | 256                                           |           |        |     | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 5.75        | 24.5         | 28              |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 4.66        | 26.0         | 168             |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.12        | 25.4         | 53              |\n|      | 4096                                          |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.75        | 26.2         | 90              |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.0      |        |               | 5.77        | 24.6         |                 |\n| (D)  |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.2      |        |               | 4.95        | 25.5         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       |          | 0.0    |               | 4.67        | 25.3         |                 |\n| (E)  | 0.2 positional embedding instead of sinusoids |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.47 4.92   | 25.7 25.7    |                 |\n| big  | 6                                             | 1024      | 4096   | 16  |       |       | 0.3      |        | 300K          | 4.33        | 26.4         | 213             |\n\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size d k hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\n\n## 6.3 English Constituency Parsing\n\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\n\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with d model = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\n\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\n\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\n\n| Parser                              | Training                 |   WSJ 23 F1 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| Vinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0 . 3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\n\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\n\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor .\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t -1 and the input for position t . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n## 2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n\n## 3 Model Architecture\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to a sequence of continuous representations z = ( z 1 , ..., z n ) . Given z , the decoder then generates an output sequence ( y 1 , ..., y m ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_1.png)\n\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\n\n## 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x +Sublayer( x )) , where Sublayer( x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512 .\n\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i .\n\n## 3.2 Attention\n\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n\n## Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_3.png)\n\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n\n## 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension d k , and values of dimension d v . We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √ d k , and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q . The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\nAttention( Q,K,V ) = softmax( QK T √ d k ) V (1)\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1 √ d k . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of d k the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d k [3]. We suspect that for large values of d k , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4 . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1 √ d k .\n\n## 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with d model-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d k , d k and d v dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d v -dimensional\n\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.\n\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n\nMultiHead( Q,K,V ) = Concat(head 1 , ..., head h ) W O where head = Attention( QW Q , KW K , V W V )\n\ni i i i\n\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q i ∈ R d model × d k , W K i ∈ R d model × d k , W V i ∈ R d model × d v and W O ∈ R hd v × d model .\n\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use d k = d v = d model /h = 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n## 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n- · In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\n- · The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n- · Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -∞ ) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n\n## 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\nFFN( x ) = max(0 , xW 1 + b 1 ) W 2 + b 2 (2)\n\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is d model = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality d ff = 2048 .\n\n## 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension d model. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √ d model.\n\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel size of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\n\n| Layer Type                  | Complexity per Layer   | Sequential Operations   | Maximum Path Length   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Self-Attention              | O ( n 2 · d )          | O (1)                   | O (1)                 |\n| Recurrent                   | O ( n · d 2 )          | O ( n )                 | O ( n )               |\n| Convolutional               | O ( k · n · d 2 )      | O (1)                   | O ( log k ( n ))      |\n| Self-Attention (restricted) | O ( r · n · d )        | O (1)                   | O ( n/r )             |\n\n## 3.5 Positional Encoding\n\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\nPE ( pos, 2 i ) = sin ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model ) PE ( pos, 2 i +1) = cos ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model )\n\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2 π to 10000 · 2 π . We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k , PE pos + k can be represented as a linear function of PE pos .\n\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\n\n## 4 Why Self-Attention\n\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to another sequence of equal length ( z 1 , ..., z n ) , with x i , z i ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O ( n ) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d , which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O ( n/r ) . We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O ( n/k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O ( log k ( n )) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k . Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O ( k · n · d + n · d 2 ) . Even with k = n , however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n\n## 5 Training\n\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n\n## 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\n\n## 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\n\n## 5.3 Optimizer\n\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β 1 = 0 . 9 , β 2 = 0 . 98 and ϵ = 10 -9 . We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\nlrate = d -0 . 5 model · min( step \\_ num -0 . 5 , step \\_ num · warmup \\_ steps -1 . 5 ) (3)\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup \\_ steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup \\_ steps = 4000 .\n\n## 5.4 Regularization\n\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\n\n| Model                           | BLEU   | BLEU   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                 | EN-DE  | EN-FR  | EN-DE                   | EN-FR                   |\n| ByteNet [18]                    | 23.75  |        |                         |                         |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk [39]          |        | 39.2   |                         | 1 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL [38]                  | 24.6   | 39.92  | 2 . 3 · 10 19           | 1 . 4 · 10 20           |\n| ConvS2S [9]                     | 25.16  | 40.46  | 9 . 6 · 10 18           | 1 . 5 · 10 20           |\n| MoE [32]                        | 26.03  | 40.56  | 2 . 0 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 20           |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] |        | 40.4   |                         | 8 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL Ensemble [38]         | 26.30  | 41.16  | 1 . 8 · 10 20           | 1 . 1 · 10 21           |\n| ConvS2S Ensemble [9]            | 26.36  | 41.29  | 7 . 7 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 21           |\n| Transformer (base model)        | 27.3   | 38.1   | 3 . 3 ·                 | 10 18                   |\n| Transformer (big)               | 28.4   | 41.8   | 2 . 3 · 10              | 19                      |\n\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of P drop = 0 . 1 .\n\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵ ls = 0 . 1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n\n## 6 Results\n\n## 6.1 Machine Translation\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2 . 0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28 . 4 . The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3 . 5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41 . 0 , outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1 / 4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P drop = 0 . 1 , instead of 0 . 3 .\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0 . 6 [38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50 , but terminate early when possible [38].\n\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5 .\n\n## 6.2 Model Variations\n\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base model. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Listed perplexities are per-wordpiece, according to our byte-pair encoding, and should not be compared to per-word perplexities.\n\n|      | N                                             | d model   | d ff   | h   | d k   | d v   | P drop   | ϵ ls   | train steps   | PPL (dev)   | BLEU (dev)   | params × 10 6   |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----|-------|-------|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| base | 6                                             | 512       | 2048   | 8   | 64    | 64    | 0.1      | 0.1    | 100K          | 4.92        | 25.8         | 65              |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 1   | 512   | 512   |          |        |               | 5.29        | 24.9         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 4   | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 5.00        | 25.5         |                 |\n| (A)  |                                               |           |        | 16  | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 4.91        | 25.8         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 32  | 16    | 16    |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     | 16    |       |          |        |               | 5.16        | 25.1         | 58              |\n| (B)  |                                               |           |        |     | 32    |       |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         | 60              |\n| (C)  | 2                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 6.11        | 23.7         | 36              |\n|      | 4                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.19        | 25.3         | 50              |\n|      | 8                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.88        | 25.5         | 80              |\n|      | 256                                           |           |        |     | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 5.75        | 24.5         | 28              |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 4.66        | 26.0         | 168             |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.12        | 25.4         | 53              |\n|      | 4096                                          |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.75        | 26.2         | 90              |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.0      |        |               | 5.77        | 24.6         |                 |\n| (D)  |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.2      |        |               | 4.95        | 25.5         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       |          | 0.0    |               | 4.67        | 25.3         |                 |\n| (E)  | 0.2 positional embedding instead of sinusoids |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.47 4.92   | 25.7 25.7    |                 |\n| big  | 6                                             | 1024      | 4096   | 16  |       |       | 0.3      |        | 300K          | 4.33        | 26.4         | 213             |\n\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size d k hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\n\n## 6.3 English Constituency Parsing\n\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\n\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with d model = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\n\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\n\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\n\n| Parser                              | Training                 |   WSJ 23 F1 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| Vinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0 . 3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\n\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\n\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor .\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t -1 and the input for position t . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n## 2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n\n## 3 Model Architecture\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to a sequence of continuous representations z = ( z 1 , ..., z n ) . Given z , the decoder then generates an output sequence ( y 1 , ..., y m ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_1.png)\n\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\n\n## 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x +Sublayer( x )) , where Sublayer( x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512 .\n\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i .\n\n## 3.2 Attention\n\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n\n## Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/AttentionModelpdf/images/tmpbewvqno6_image_3.png)\n\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n\n## 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension d k , and values of dimension d v . We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √ d k , and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q . The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\nAttention( Q,K,V ) = softmax( QK T √ d k ) V (1)\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1 √ d k . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of d k the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d k [3]. We suspect that for large values of d k , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4 . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1 √ d k .\n\n## 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with d model-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d k , d k and d v dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d v -dimensional\n\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.\n\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n\nMultiHead( Q,K,V ) = Concat(head 1 , ..., head h ) W O where head = Attention( QW Q , KW K , V W V )\n\ni i i i\n\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q i ∈ R d model × d k , W K i ∈ R d model × d k , W V i ∈ R d model × d v and W O ∈ R hd v × d model .\n\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use d k = d v = d model /h = 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n## 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n- · In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\n- · The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n- · Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -∞ ) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n\n## 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\nFFN( x ) = max(0 , xW 1 + b 1 ) W 2 + b 2 (2)\n\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is d model = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality d ff = 2048 .\n\n## 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension d model. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √ d model.\n\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel size of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\n\n| Layer Type                  | Complexity per Layer   | Sequential Operations   | Maximum Path Length   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Self-Attention              | O ( n 2 · d )          | O (1)                   | O (1)                 |\n| Recurrent                   | O ( n · d 2 )          | O ( n )                 | O ( n )               |\n| Convolutional               | O ( k · n · d 2 )      | O (1)                   | O ( log k ( n ))      |\n| Self-Attention (restricted) | O ( r · n · d )        | O (1)                   | O ( n/r )             |\n\n## 3.5 Positional Encoding\n\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\nPE ( pos, 2 i ) = sin ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model ) PE ( pos, 2 i +1) = cos ( pos/ 10000 2 i/d model )\n\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2 π to 10000 · 2 π . We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k , PE pos + k can be represented as a linear function of PE pos .\n\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\n\n## 4 Why Self-Attention\n\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations ( x 1 , ..., x n ) to another sequence of equal length ( z 1 , ..., z n ) , with x i , z i ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O ( n ) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d , which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O ( n/r ) . We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O ( n/k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O ( log k ( n )) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k . Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O ( k · n · d + n · d 2 ) . Even with k = n , however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n\n## 5 Training\n\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n\n## 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\n\n## 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\n\n## 5.3 Optimizer\n\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β 1 = 0 . 9 , β 2 = 0 . 98 and ϵ = 10 -9 . We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\nlrate = d -0 . 5 model · min( step \\_ num -0 . 5 , step \\_ num · warmup \\_ steps -1 . 5 ) (3)\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup \\_ steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup \\_ steps = 4000 .\n\n## 5.4 Regularization\n\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\n\n| Model                           | BLEU   | BLEU   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   | Training Cost (FLOPs)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                 | EN-DE  | EN-FR  | EN-DE                   | EN-FR                   |\n| ByteNet [18]                    | 23.75  |        |                         |                         |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk [39]          |        | 39.2   |                         | 1 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL [38]                  | 24.6   | 39.92  | 2 . 3 · 10 19           | 1 . 4 · 10 20           |\n| ConvS2S [9]                     | 25.16  | 40.46  | 9 . 6 · 10 18           | 1 . 5 · 10 20           |\n| MoE [32]                        | 26.03  | 40.56  | 2 . 0 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 20           |\n| Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] |        | 40.4   |                         | 8 . 0 · 10 20           |\n| GNMT + RL Ensemble [38]         | 26.30  | 41.16  | 1 . 8 · 10 20           | 1 . 1 · 10 21           |\n| ConvS2S Ensemble [9]            | 26.36  | 41.29  | 7 . 7 · 10 19           | 1 . 2 · 10 21           |\n| Transformer (base model)        | 27.3   | 38.1   | 3 . 3 ·                 | 10 18                   |\n| Transformer (big)               | 28.4   | 41.8   | 2 . 3 · 10              | 19                      |\n\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of P drop = 0 . 1 .\n\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵ ls = 0 . 1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n\n## 6 Results\n\n## 6.1 Machine Translation\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2 . 0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28 . 4 . The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3 . 5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41 . 0 , outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1 / 4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P drop = 0 . 1 , instead of 0 . 3 .\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0 . 6 [38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50 , but terminate early when possible [38].\n\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5 .\n\n## 6.2 Model Variations\n\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base model. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Listed perplexities are per-wordpiece, according to our byte-pair encoding, and should not be compared to per-word perplexities.\n\n|      | N                                             | d model   | d ff   | h   | d k   | d v   | P drop   | ϵ ls   | train steps   | PPL (dev)   | BLEU (dev)   | params × 10 6   |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|-----|-------|-------|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| base | 6                                             | 512       | 2048   | 8   | 64    | 64    | 0.1      | 0.1    | 100K          | 4.92        | 25.8         | 65              |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 1   | 512   | 512   |          |        |               | 5.29        | 24.9         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 4   | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 5.00        | 25.5         |                 |\n| (A)  |                                               |           |        | 16  | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 4.91        | 25.8         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        | 32  | 16    | 16    |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     | 16    |       |          |        |               | 5.16        | 25.1         | 58              |\n| (B)  |                                               |           |        |     | 32    |       |          |        |               | 5.01        | 25.4         | 60              |\n| (C)  | 2                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 6.11        | 23.7         | 36              |\n|      | 4                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.19        | 25.3         | 50              |\n|      | 8                                             |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.88        | 25.5         | 80              |\n|      | 256                                           |           |        |     | 32    | 32    |          |        |               | 5.75        | 24.5         | 28              |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     | 128   | 128   |          |        |               | 4.66        | 26.0         | 168             |\n|      |                                               | 1024      |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.12        | 25.4         | 53              |\n|      | 4096                                          |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 4.75        | 26.2         | 90              |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.0      |        |               | 5.77        | 24.6         |                 |\n| (D)  |                                               |           |        |     |       |       | 0.2      |        |               | 4.95        | 25.5         |                 |\n|      |                                               |           |        |     |       |       |          | 0.0    |               | 4.67        | 25.3         |                 |\n| (E)  | 0.2 positional embedding instead of sinusoids |           |        |     |       |       |          |        |               | 5.47 4.92   | 25.7 25.7    |                 |\n| big  | 6                                             | 1024      | 4096   | 16  |       |       | 0.3      |        | 300K          | 4.33        | 26.4         | 213             |\n\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size d k hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\n\n## 6.3 English Constituency Parsing\n\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\n\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with d model = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\n\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\n\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\n\n| Parser                              | Training                 |   WSJ 23 F1 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| Vinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0 . 3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\n\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\n\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor .\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Harrod, Bridget K. Welch, & Jeff Kushkowski Iowa State University\n\n## ABSTRACT\n\nWe examined trends in group research published in Social Psychology Quarterly (SPQ) from 1975 to 2005.  We identified a total of 332 papers about groups published during the time period.  Following Moreland, Hogg, and Hains (1994), we created an index of interest in groups by dividing the number of pages in papers about groups by the total number of journal pages. Results show that interest in groups in SPQ generally fell from the late 1970s through the 1980s, rose during most of the 1990s, but stalled in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  In 2005 interest in groups hovered just under the 31-year average.  We examined the impact of European and social cognition approaches, expectation states theory, social exchange theory, and symbolic interactionism on these trends.  The most popular topic of research is group structure.  The most common research method is the laboratory experiment.  Papers about groups have increased in length, number of references, and number of authors.  Most papers report a single study.  The most productive authors and most influential papers are identified.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nSocial psychologists have always been interested in groups.  In the early 1970s, however, Ivan Steiner noticed a drop in the level of social psychologists' interest.  In his famous paper, \"Whatever Happened to the Group in Social Psychology?\" Steiner hypothesized that a period of social tranquility decreases social psychological interest in groups:  \"My point is that when society is serene, and only a few wrong-headed deviants disturb our tranquility, we focus our attention on individuals or on large organizations.  But when many small segments of society are vying with one another, our attention is drawn to units of intermediate size\" (Steiner 1974:105). Steiner predicted that a period of social unrest would produce an upward trend in social psychologists' publications about groups (with a possible lag of 8 to 10 years), whereas a period of social calm would produce a downward trend.  He noted that the Great Depression and WWII were times of turmoil, and they spawned a very \"groupy\" social psychology in the late 1940s and 1950s.  The 1950s were a time of tranquility, and that was followed by \"the hibernation of the group\" in the 1960s.  Because the 1960s and early 1970s were hardly tranquil times, Steiner predicted that by the late 1970s, \"the group will rise again!\"  However, by the 1980s it became clear that group dynamics was not becoming increasingly more popular, and Steiner (1983; 1986) twice revised his optimistic predictions.  Despite his frustration in predicting trends, Steiner did succeed in drawing attention to trends in social psychological publications about groups, and in making the study of these trends an interesting topic for research.\n\nSteiner described the \"groupy\" (versus individualistic) approach to research as looking for causes that are located outside the individual, that are located in the collective actions of others or in the constraints imposed by the larger system.  The individual is presumed to be part of a larger system, a small group, an organization, or society.  Fellow group members may or not be visible, but they help predict and explain behavior (Steiner 1974).  Steiner never collected empirical data on publication trends, and thus never provided an operational definition of group research.\n\nMoreland, Hogg, and Hains (1994) (henceforth referred to as MHH) were the first to collect data on publications about groups and test Steiner's hypothesis.  MHH at first thought it would be easy to identify papers about groups by simply looking for papers on classic topics like conformity or group decision-making, that reported data collected from several participants who interacted with each other.  They found many papers like that, but soon confronted some complications.  One complication was the issue of whether or not to include dyads in their definition of groups.  Others include dyads in their definition of groups (see Forsyth 2006), but MHH reasoned that dyads seem different from other groups in many ways, and that some phenomena that occur in groups (like coalition formation, majority/minority influence, and socialization) cannot occur in dyads at all.  MHH decided that \"most\" research on dyads should be excluded, with two kinds of exceptions.  In some papers on dyadic bargaining, the parties represented the interests of constituent groups, and these kinds of papers would be included.  In other papers, group behavior was studied using data collected, \"perhaps as a methodological convenience,\" from dyads.  These kinds of dyadic papers were included only if a \"clear interest in group phenomena was apparent\" (Moreland et al. 1994:531).  They cite Nyquist and Spence (1986) as an example of this kind of paper.  Nyquist and Spence studied the contribution of gender as a status characteristic to the determination of leadership choice in task-focused groups. The researchers paired male and female participants with high and low dispositional\n\n(personality) dominance, and found that men were more likely to assume leadership of mixed sex groups even when the men scored lower in dispositional dominance than their female partners.  Their method involved dyads but their theory focused on whether men possess more legitimate authority in task groups even when personality may dictate otherwise.  Furthermore, MHH did not limit their definition of group research only to studies of small, face-to-face, interacting groups.  MHH also included studies of stereotyping, prejudice, intergroup contact, and ingroup bias between members of racial, ethnic, or national groups.\n\nMHH studied group research published from 1975 to 1993 in psychological social psychology journals (i.e., Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , and Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin ).  Contrary to Steiner's predictions, MHH found that interest in groups continued to fall during the late 1970s, remained low in the 1980s, but rose again in the 1990s.  They concluded that developments within the field of social psychology itself, rather than levels of unrest in society, explain these trends.  In particular, they attributed the growing interest in groups in the 1990s to the growing popularity of European approaches (especially social identity theory) and to the growing popularity of social cognition theories and methods (e.g., stereotyping theories and implicit priming methods).  MHH content analyzed the papers about groups, and looked for trends in topics of interest.  Their results showed an enormous increase in interest in intergroup relations, making it the most popular topic in psychological social psychological studies of groups.  In contrast, intra-group topics were much less popular.  Interest in group performance had dropped significantly.  The study of group structure was even less popular.\n\nSanna and Parks (1997) were the next to study trends in publications about groups.  Given the focus on intergroup topics in psychological social psychology journals, Sanna and Parks proposed to find out, \"Whatever Happened to Intragroup Research?\"  They reasoned that a logical place to look for intra-group research would be applied and organizational psychology journals (i.e., Journal of Applied Psychology , Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes , and Academy of Management Journal ).  Sanna and Parks' study of publications from 1975 through 1994 showed that group performance is the most popular topic of group research in the applied and organizational literature.  They found negligible interest in intergroup relations. They also found negligible interest in the study of group structure.  Like MHH, Sanna and Parks found that interest in groups fell during the late 1970s, remained low in the 1980s, and rose again in the 1990s.  Sanna and Parks concluded that group publications rose in the 1990s in part because social psychologists with papers about intra-group processes started sending these kinds of papers to applied and organizational journals rather than to psychological social psychology journals.\n\n## WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GROUP RESEARCH IN SOCIOLOGICAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY?\n\nDespite the popularity of group research in sociological social psychology, neither MHH nor Sanna and Parks included sociologically oriented journals in their analysis.  A search of Web of Knowledge failed to uncover any published research examining trends in group research published in sociologically oriented journals.  If intergroup relations is the most popular topic in psychological social psychology, and if group performance is the most popular topic in applied\n\nand organizational psychology, then what is the most popular topic of group research in sociological social psychology?  We hypothesized that it would be the study of group structure. Sociological social psychology seems a likely place to find the study of group structure, given the history of its major journal, and the nature of its classic contributions to the study of groups.\n\nSociological social psychology inherited a focus on sociometry through the history of its major journal.  The American Sociological Association's major journal of social psychology, Social Psychology Quarterly ( SPQ ), started out in 1937 as Sociometry:  A Journal of Interpersonal Relations . Sociometry was founded by J. L. Moreno (first published as Sociometric Review in 1936), as an outlet for research combining \"socius-structure of the group\" and \"metrummeasurement\" (Moreno 1955b:17).  At that time, Sociometry was not a sociology journal, but an interdisciplinary journal \"dealing with sociometric and near-sociometric small group research\" (Moreno 1954:186).  Its editor was a psychologist (Gardner Murphy), and its eclectic editorial board included psychiatrists and anthropologists (e.g., Margaret Mead).  Moreno believed Sociometry was more advanced than 1930s-style sociology (which he characterized as American \"armchair\" sociology) because his journal explored the dynamics of group structure with measurement instruments like the sociometric test, sociometric questionnaire, social distance scale, and sociogram (Moreno 1955b:15-16).\n\nMoreno, however, was closely associated with sociology, and belonged to the American Sociological Society.  When Moreno decided to step down as editor in 1955, he gave Sociometry to the American Sociological Society.  The journal's name changed to Sociometry:  Journal of Research in Social Psychology in 1956, and the new editors broadened the scope of the journal to focus on \"the systematic exploration of the processes and products of social interaction at the interpersonal, intrapersonal, intergroup and intragroup levels\" (Editorial 1956).  In 1978 Sociometry changed its name to Social Psychology and in 1979 to Social Psychology Quarterly . The purpose of the journal's name change was to reflect more accurately the broad field of theory and research in social psychology.  Nevertheless, the journal continued (as stated on the inside cover) to publish \"articles concerning the processes and products of social interaction,\" suggesting that studies of group structure would still find a home.  The journal further broadened its scope in 1988 (as stated on the inside cover) to \"publishing papers on the link between the individual and society,\" but it continued with the tradition of welcoming sociometric research (e.g., Hallinan and Kubitschek 1990).\n\nFurthermore, many of the classic (non-sociometric) contributions to group research by sociologists have focused on group structure, and the pages of SPQ show that these classic contributions continue to influence sociological research today.  Robert Bales (1958) examined roles and role differentiation in small groups.  Berger, Cohen and Zelditch (1972) examined status characteristics and social interaction.  The continuing impact of these classic contributions can be found in contemporary research on roles and statuses in groups (e.g., Van Rossem and Vermande 2004; Whitmeyer, Webster, and Rashotte 2005).  George C. Homans (1958) examined patterns of social exchange and distributive justice in groups.  The impact of his ideas can be found in contemporary research on exchange networks and on social justice (e.g., Hegtvedt and Johnson 2000; Walker et al. 2000).  The early symbolic interactionists were also interested in group structure (Shalin 1986).  Thrasher (1927) and Whyte (1943) examined group structure as an emergent process in their studies of street gangs.  Other symbolic interactionists\n\n(e.g., Kuhn and McPartland 1954) studied group structure as a pre-existing, organized, stable pattern of interaction on the basis of which individuals derive their sense of self, their definitions of the situation, and their choice of modes of conduct.  The ideas of early symbolic interactionists continue to influence contemporary research focusing on group structure (e.g., Jimerson 1999; Troyer, Younts, and Kalkhoff 2001).\n\nHistory, then, suggests that sociological social psychology should have an active program of group research, specializing in the topic of group structure.  On the other hand, some contemporary researchers have expressed concern about a decline in group research in sociology (Harrington and Fine 2000; Burke 2003).  If this were the case, it would be problematic indeed, as the study of groups in one of the pillars of sociological social psychology (Delamater 2003:xi).  Although sociological social psychologists may express concern about the demise of the study of groups, we were unable to find any quantitative analysis that would indicate if their fears were justified.  Hence, we set out to conduct some research of our own.  We decided to examine papers published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005. SPQ is not the only sociologically oriented journal of social psychology, but it is the flagship journal of sociological social psychology.  It seemed to us to be the best place to find trends in sociologically oriented group research.  In Study One, our goal was to adopt the methodology of MHH to study trends in group research in SPQ .  In Study Two, we intended to characterize the nature of group research published in SPQ , using some basic bibliometric methods.\n\n## STUDY ONE\n\nIn this study we examined trends in the popularity of group research, determined what are the most common topics and methods, and tried to identify the most important theoretical influences. Data come from papers published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005.  We compare our results with those found in previous research.\n\n## Method\n\nWe examined every paper published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005 (including awards, book reviews, and comments), and identified the papers about groups.  Most of the papers about groups involved the direct study of naturally occurring or experimentally formed groups.  For instance, we found observational and survey research on naturally occurring groups such as football teams (Rees and Segal 1984), classrooms (Hallinan 1979), dormitory residents (MacNeil, Davis, and Pace 1975), sororities (Paxton and Moody 2003), juries (Manzo 1996), and therapy groups (McCarrick, Manderscheid, and Silbergeld 1981).  We also found studies of ad hoc experimental groups in papers about N-person prisonerÕs dilemmas (Bonachich 1976), choice shifts (Hong, 1978), social exchange (Simpson and Borch 2005), and coalition formation (Komorita and Brinberg 1977).  In some cases, the experimental groups included confederates or simulated partners (e.g., Kaplan 1977).\n\nNeither the research method nor the number of participants, however, was a decisive factor in determining whether the paper was about groups.  For instance, some theoretical papers (e.g., Harrington and Fine 2000) and some comments (e.g., Nemeth 1983) were about groups, despite the fact that they did not involve the direct study of any participants.  Other papers about groups\n\ninvolved the direct study of individuals.  This was especially true of experimental and survey research about intergroup relations, on topics such as social identity (Ellmers, Van Dyck, Hinkle, and Jacobs 2000), stereotyping (Gaertner and McLaughlin 1983), or contact (Stephan 1977). Likewise, papers involving the direct study of dyads could be about groups.  In some cases the dyads were categorized into groups (Yamagishi and Kiyonari 2000), or the dyads were representatives of groups (Insko, Schopler, Kennedy, and Dahl 1992).  In other cases, the researchers used dyads as a methodological convenience to test a theory about groups.  For instance, Ridgeway, Diekema and Johnson (1995) studied the legitimacy of hierarchy in peer groups.  In the theory section of their paper, the authors make it clear that the topic is about groups.  They define peer groups as homogeneous interactional groups whose members do not obviously differ in external status characteristics or established skill levels.  They give an example by adding that, Òinformal groups among people working at the same job or among students are often peer groups of this typeÓ (p. 298).  In the methods section of the paper, the authors make it clear that they studied dyads as a methodological convenience.  The authors explain that they needed to create task-oriented groups with emergent influence hierarchies, and that Òto accomplish this in the simplest way, we formed task-oriented dyads of one confederate and one na·ve subjectÓ (p. 303).  Because a Òclear interest in group phenomena was apparent,Ó we included this dyadic paper in the category of group research, following MHHÕs guidelines.\n\nAlso following MHHÕs guidelines, we did not count dyadic papers as being about groups if they focused particularly on dyads, and were not just using dyads as a methodological convenience to test a theory about groups.  Most of the papers eliminated on this basis were either about romantic couples (e.g., Schafer and Keith 1980; Cast 2003) or about dyadic models of equity (e.g., Moschetti 1979, 1982; Alessio 1980) or social exchange (e.g., Molm 1979a, 1979b, 1980, 1981a, and 1981b).\n\nSocial exchange papers by Linda D. Molm illustrate our reasoning.  In a series of papers, Molm (1979a, 1979b, 1980, 1981a, and 1981b) tested hypotheses about reinforcement on behavior. Two participants, isolated from each other, sat in front of experimental consoles with three sets of stimulus lights, two response buttons, and a Òreinforcer panelÓ with lights and a counter indicating the sum of money earned.  Participants knew that the colored stimulus lights were associated with the patterns of button presses that would produce earnings, and they knew that at any phase of the experiment their earnings might depend upon their own responses, the other personÕs responses, or their joint response.  Participants did not know, however, what the reinforcement patterns or contingencies were.  Molm manipulated the amount of money earned by different responses (i.e., sequences of button pushes) across different stages of the experiments, and tested the impact of differential reinforcement contingencies on behavior. Since the theory (having to do with operant conditioning and reward contingencies) and the research paradigm specifically focused on dyadic behavior, we did not count these papers as being about groups.  Three later publications by Molm, however, we did count as being about groups.  In one, she studied dyads embedded in a 4-person exchange network with two simulated partners (Molm 1988); in a second paper, she studied single participants in a 4-person exchange network with three simulated partners (Molm 1994a); and in a third paper, she wrote a theoretical analysis about social exchange in networks and groups (Molm 1994b).\n\nOur classification of MolmÕs earlier social exchange publications as being specifically about dyads is consistent with Yamagishi and CookÕs (1993) assessment of social exchange research. They describe ÒtraditionalÓ social exchange theory as limited primarily to the analysis of dyadic exchange relations.  They say that in response to this limitation, researchers then Òlaunched a series of theoretical and empirical efforts to extend social exchange theory beyond the initial, fairly narrow dyadic perspectiveÓ (p. 235).  Yamagishi and Cook explain that the first avenue for extending social exchange theory beyond its dyadic perspective was to embed these relations in larger network structures (as Molm did in her later research).  Thus, Yamagishi and CookÕs description of ÒtraditionalÓ versus extended social exchange theory is consistent with our conclusion that MolmÕs earlier papers were about dyads but her later papers were about groups.\n\nWe collected data on the papers about groups following the methods and coding categories used by MHH.  We coded papers on the basis of their research methods and topics (see Appendix A for examples of articles from each of the topical areas).  We coded papers according to whether they reflected European or social cognition approaches utilizing the same parameters set by MHH.  Influence by a European approach was indicated in a paper by its discussion of and citations to minority influence or social representations theories by Moscovici and his colleagues, or to social identity and self categorization theories by Tajfel and Turner, and their colleagues.  Nationality of the paper's authors played no part in the determination of European influence.  Influence by a social cognition approach was indicated by a paper's discussion of and citations to any attribution theory, or any theory of cognitive structure or process (e.g., cognitive balance, cognitive consistency, attitudes, heuristics).  Also included in the social cognition approach were papers that included self theory and the measurement of self (e.g., self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-concept).  Finally, papers reporting use of any cognitive method (e.g., recall, priming, response latency, implicit association) were counted as being influenced the social cognition approach.\n\nIn addition to following MHH's coding strategies, we also wanted to examine the possible influences of theories identified by Delamater (2003) as ÒbasicÓ to contemporary sociological social psychology.  Delamater identified five such basic theoretical perspectives: symbolic interactionism (SI), social exchange, expectation states (EST), social structure and personality (SS&P), and evolutionary social psychology (ESP).  So in addition to coding papers on European and social cognition approaches, we also kept track of whether a paper was influenced by any of these five basic theories.  In our analysis, SI included classic, structural, and identity approaches, dramaturgy, and conversation analysis.  EST included status characteristics theory, status construction theory, and various theories about performance expectations based on rewards or interchange patterns. Social exchange theory included research on bargaining, coalitions, equity, distributive justice, economic sociology, and social dilemma/game theoretical research.  SS&P included theories about the impact of social stratification or social class on individual feelings, attitudes and behaviors particularly in school, work, family and health contexts; theories of modernity or social change as they impact psychological functioning; life course theories; and any other research elaborating on the work of Kohn and Schooler.  ESP included theories explaining human social behavior by characteristics humans share with other animals such as biological factors or ecological factors, and evolutionary perspectives on reproduction, aggression, or altruism.\n\nWe dummy coded papers (zero or one) for the influence of each of the two approaches and five theories.  Thus, it was possible for papers to be influenced by any combination of approaches and theories, or to be influenced by none at all.  Most papers (76%) were influenced by at least one of the approaches or theories (see Appendix B for examples of articles influenced by the approaches and theories).\n\nTo assess the reliability of judgments about group research, one of us (Welch) independently evaluated 103 papers randomly selected out of the 1,037 papers evaluated by another one of us (Harrod).  We achieved 98% agreement in our evaluations of whether a paper is about groups. This yielded a Cohen's kappa value of .96.  To asses the reliability of other judgments, one of us (Welch) independently evaluated 33 papers randomly selected out of the subset of (332) group papers evaluated by another one of us (Harrod).  In judging European approach, we achieved 97% agreement, and this yielded a Cohen's kappa of value of .83.  The percentage of agreement and the Cohen's kappa value for other judgments are as follows:  social cognition approach, 94% and .85;  EST, 97% and .83;  exchange theory, 100% agreement;  SI, 97% and .87;  research method, 94% and .92;  and topic, 90% and .89.  These are good reliability levels.  One of us (Harrod) then coded papers for the influence of SS&P and ESP.\n\n## Results\n\nWe identified 332 papers about groups out of the 1,037 papers published from 1975 to 2005. The number of papers about groups per year reached a low of 2 in 1987, and a high of 19 in 1976, with an average of 10.7 per year.  Following MHH, we counted the number of pages in papers about groups and divided that number by the total number of pages in all papers in the journal to construct an \"index of interest in groups.\"  Figure 1 shows the index of interest in groups in SPQ from 1975 to 2005.  This index ranges from a low of 5.1% in 1987 to a high of 54.9% in 1995, with an average of 31.2%.  Data from psychological social psychology journals (reconstructed with permission from Richard Moreland), and from applied and organizational psychology journals (reconstructed with permission from Lawrence Sanna and Craig Parks) are shown in the bottom of Figure 1.  In comparison to these other journals, SPQ has a much higher level of interest in groups.  In every year except 1987 (which included a special issue on language), SPQ published relatively more pages of papers on groups than did the psychological journals.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/psychopdf/images/tmp2igvqxoq_image_1.png)\n\nWe performed a number of polynomial regressions to test for linear, quadratic, and cubic effects of years on index of interest.  We found that a cubic regression equation best describes the data, F (3,30) = 3.57, p < .03, with an R 2 of about 28%, and a Durbin-Watson statistic of 2.01, indicating little serial correlation among adjacent residuals.  The trendline is shown in Figure 1. It indicates that in SPQ interest in groups generally fell through the late 1970s and 1980s, rose into the 1990s, but stalled in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  In 2005, interest in groups hovered under the 31-year average.\n\nFollowing MHH, we looked for changes in the popularity of the social psychological approaches and theories to explain these trends.  We constructed measures of popularity by counting the number of pages in papers about groups influenced by each approach and theory, and divided those numbers by the total number of pages in all papers in the journal.  After determining popularity by year, we tested for linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic trends.  Results are shown in Figure 2.  The popularity of European and social cognition approaches are best represented by upward linear trends, whereas the popularity of EST, exchange, and SI are best represented by quartic, cubic, and linear trends, respectively.  On average, social cognition and EST have been the most popular theoretical perspectives in group papers in SPQ .  Group papers about social cognition made up 9.94% of all pages published in SPQ during the 31-year period, and group papers about EST made up 9.20%.\n\nThe popularity of SS&P and ESP are not shown in Figure 2 because we found too few group papers influenced by these theories to justify trend analysis.  Only 8 group papers were\n\ninfluenced by SS&P and only 5 by ESP in the 31-year period.  With most years showing zero popularity, we decided that the influence of SS&P and ESP could not help explain trends in the popularity of group research.  Therefore, we dropped consideration of the influence of SS&P and ESP from further analysis.\n\nFigure 2 Trends in the popularity of approaches and theories in SPQ\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/psychopdf/images/tmp2igvqxoq_image_2.png)\n\nFollowing MHH, we subtracted the pages associated with the approaches and theories from the overall index of interest in groups, and re-estimated trends in order to understand which perspectives contributed most to the observed increase in popularity of group research during the 1990s.  Figure 3 shows that a rejuvenation of interest in groups in the 1990s would not have taken place without the contribution of European and social cognition approaches.  Figure 3 shows the cubic trendline for the overall index of interest in groups in SPQ , along with the reestimated trendline after taking out pages in papers influenced by social cognition, and after taking out pages in papers influenced by the European approach.  Without either of these approaches, interest in groups would have continued to fall well into the 1990s before starting a slow, partial recovery.  Without the European or the social cognition approaches, the average index of interest in groups across the 31-year period would have been reduced from 31.2% to 23.3% and 21.3%, respectively.\n\n3 Influence of approaches and theories on nnterest nn groups nn SPQ Figurc\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/psychopdf/images/tmp2igvqxoq_image_3.png)\n\nFigure 3 also shows that SI, exchange, and EST each played a role in reviving interest in groups in the 1990s.  The index of interest in groups would not have been reduced very much before the 1990s if papers about SI were subtracted.  After that point, however, removing pages inspired by SI would noticeably pull down the interest in groups.  Over the 31-year period, the average index of interest in groups would have been reduced to 27.0% without the influence of SI.  Social exchange theory played an even bigger role than SI in supporting group research, particularly starting in the late 1980s.  Without papers inspired by exchange, interest in groups would have fallen through most of the 1990s, and the average index of interest in groups would have been reduced to 23.6%.  EST had an even bigger impact.  Without the influence of EST, interest in groups would have continued to go down across the 31-year period.  There would have been no revival starting in the 1990s.  By the late 1990s group research would have been in the doldrums. Without papers inspired by EST, the average index of interest in groups would be 22.0%.\n\nThe research methods used in papers about groups are shown in Table 1.  Laboratory experiments account for almost half of the research methods in the group papers published in SPQ .  This is substantially lower than the popularity of lab experiments found in group publications in psychological social psychology journals, but comparable to that found in applied and organizational psychology journals. SPQ publishes more group research using surveys than the other journals. SPQ publishes substantially more papers using \"other\" methods, including commentaries, awards, and editorial introductions.\n\nTable 1.

The psychological social psychology journals evaluated were Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , and Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin for the years 1975-1993 (Moreland et al. 1994).  The applied/organizational psychology journals evaluated were the Journal of Applied Psychology , Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes , and Academy of Management Journal for the years 1975-1994 (Sanna and Parks 1997).  The evaluation of SPQ was for the years 1975-2005.\n\nThe topics addressed in papers about groups are shown in Table 2.  As expected, group structure is the most popular topic in the papers published in SPQ .  A substantially greater proportion of papers about group structure are published in SPQ than are published in either psychological social psychology or applied and organizational psychology journals.  Intergroup relations is somewhat popular in SPQ , but much less so than in the psychological social psychology journals.  Perhaps the most surprising finding in Table 2 is the relative neglect of group performance in the pages of SPQ .  Group performance is either the most or second most popular topic in the psychological journals, but it appears to get short shrift in SPQ .\n\nTable 2.

These data show that group structure has been and continues to be the single most popular topic of group research in SPQ .  Group structure dipped somewhat in popularity during the periods 1985 to 1989 and 1990 to 1994, when this topic accounted for 35% and 26.2% of all pages in papers about groups, respectively.  However, group structure shot back up in popularity during the period 1990 to 1994, accounting for an impressive 51.1% of all pages in papers about groups.  Table 3 shows that interest in social dilemmas and power appears to have increased, but interest in bargaining and coalitions, and in minority/majority influence has gone down.  Interest in every aspect of group performance has gone down.  In the area of intergroup relations, only the topic of social identity appears to be growing in popularity.\n\nTable 3.

The level of interest in groups, however, does not seem to respond to levels of unrest in society as Steiner predicted.  The 1960s and 1970s were times of social unrest in American society, but the popularity of groups in SPQ fell in the late 1970s and remained low through the 1980s.  The 1980s were a period of social calm in America, but the popularity of groups in SPQ increased in the 1990s.  Whether terrorist attacks or the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will eventually boost interest in groups is unknown, but recent interest in groups appears to be hovering below the 31year average.\n\nInterest in groups in SPQ does seem to be explained by developments in the field of social psychology.  The two developments that MHH claimed to have boosted interest in groups in psychological social psychology also seem to have boosted interest in groups in sociological social psychology.  These are the growing popularity of European approaches (especially social identity theory) and the growing popularity of social cognition.  These approaches pulled group research out of a decline in psychology, and apparently did so in sociology as well.\n\nThe popularity of group research in SPQ , however, can also be explained closer to home by developments within the field of sociology itself.  Our data show that Berger was correct in 1992 when he said, \"Within the past few years, I believe we have witnessed the emergence (or reemergence) of the Ônew group process movement':  social psychologists in sociology who are concerned with research and theory on interpersonal or group processes and structures\" (Berger 1992:9).  Group research had indeed started to take off by the 1990s.  Our data show that Berger was also correct in identifying two of the biggest contributors to the resurgence in popularity of group research in the 1990s:  exciting new developments in exchange theory (stimulated by the work of Karen Cook, Linda Molm, Toshio Yamagishi, Jane Sell, and others) and in EST (stimulated by the work of James Balkwell, Cecilia Ridgeway, and others).  Although not as apparent in 1992 when Berger commented on the field, SI would also play a role in the reemergence group research.  Ethnographic studies of existing groups (for instance by Fine, Cahill, Lois, Jimerson, and others) became more common in SPQ .\n\nThe topic of group structure is neglected in psychological social psychology and in applied and organizational psychology, but it is the major topic of interest in SPQ .  In other words, the topic of group structure characterizes not just the classic but also the contemporary contributions of sociologists to the understanding of small groups.  Remarkably, however, the study of structure has not been accompanied by the study of function.  Relatively little group research published in SPQ has focused on the quality or quantity of group performance.  Also surprising for a sociologically oriented journal is the relative lack of research published on the topic of intergroup conflict.  Hunt et al. (2000) content analyzed papers published in SPQ according to whether they dealt with race/ethnicity.  They found a surprising lack of research on this topic. Our data seem to echo their findings.\n\n## STUDY TWO\n\nOur goal in Study Two was to characterize the nature of group research published in SPQ , from 1975 to 2005, using some basic bibliometric methods.  Bibliometric methods refer to the quantification of bibliographic information such as authors, references, and citations. Bibliometric analysis answers questions such as who are the most prolific authors and which are the most influential studies?  Bibliometric analysis can also be used to gauge the scientific progress of a field of research (e.g., Qui-ones-Vidal et al. 2004).\n\n## Method\n\nWe used the dataset of 332 papers described in Study One.  In this dataset, we collected information about the number of authors and number of studies per paper, the national affiliation of first authors, number of references, and the methods and topics of papers.  We also obtained\n\ninformation from the Web of Science, using the \"advanced search\" option.  We selected \"Social Sciences Citation Index,\" and typed in the search box, \"SO = Sociometry or SO = Social Psychology or SO = Social Psychology Quarterly\" to find papers from our source journal under its three names.  We selected \"all documents.\"  After clicking on the results, we used the \"publication years\" tool to click on years 1975 to 2005, and then clicked on \"view records.\"  This procedure gave us the list of all papers published in the journal from 1975 to 2005.  We used the \"analyze\" by \"author\" options to create a list of the most productive authors, and used the data set we had created in Study One to verify how many of each author's papers were about groups. We used the \"citation report\" tool to get a list of the most cited papers, and again we used the data set we had created in Study One to verify whether or not each paper was about groups.\n\n## Results\n\nTable 4 shows the most productive authors of group research published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005 (based on our definition of group research as explained in Study One).  Almost all of these authors study topics related to status or social exchange.  All except one (Yamagishi) have American institutional affiliations.  Four of the top ten authors are women.  Table 5 shows the most influential (in terms of citations) group papers published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005 (based on our definition of group research as explained in Study One).  These data must be interpreted with caution.  Citation counts are often inaccurate (especially when authors list their names differently or when citations are incomplete or faulty).  Citation counts do not indicate the quality of a paper.  Older papers and review articles generally have more citations.  Among the most productive group authors, Yamagishi has three of the most influential group papers, Cook has one (coauthored with Yamagishi), and Hallinan has one.  Ten out of the 21 most influential papers are authored or coauthored by women.  The most frequent topics are group structure (6 papers), intergroup relations (6 papers), and social dilemmas (3 papers).  The most common methods are experiments (11 papers) and field studies (6 papers).\n\nTable 4.

Linear regression shows that the average number of authors per paper has increased significantly over the years, F (1,331) = 9.75, p < .003.  The percentage of single authored papers is down.  The percentage of first authors from North America has fallen significantly across the time periods shown, Chi Square = 25.26, df. =12, p =.0136.  Data on papers show that they are getting longer.  The average number of pages per paper has increased across the years, F (1,331) = 72.82, p <.0001, as has the average number of references, F (1,331) = 114.06, p <.0001.  The average number of studies per paper, however, has not increased, and the percentage of single study papers has not gone down.  The proportion of papers reporting experiments, surveys, or other methods has significantly changed over the time periods shown, Chi Square = 25.26, df . = 12, p = .0136.

Intergroup relations is a topic of influential papers, but is not studied by the most productive authors.  Descriptive data on authorship and papers show a mixed picture of \"scientific maturity.\"  On the one hand, increasing collaboration and international diversity among authors\n\nis a favorable sign.  Qui-ones-Vidal et al. (2004) point out that the highest levels of collaboration are found in the \"hard sciences\" and the lowest in the humanities.  Collaboration is an indicator of \"scientific maturity\" because it suggests the existence of synergistic teamwork, an established program of research, external funding, and a pipeline of dissertations and journal publications. Single authors simply cannot be as productive as research teams.  On the other hand, the complexity and rigor of group research does not appear to be increasing.  Most articles still report a single study, and the use of nonexperimental methods has somewhat increased.  The papers are longer and the list of references has increased, but the explanation for these trends is unclear (see Adair and Vohra 2003).\n\n## GENERAL DISCUSSION\n\nOur research is the first to characterize and analyze trends in group research published in sociological social psychology.  Our empirical findings can be compared to Steiner's unflattering characterization of the field of group research in sociology:\n\n\"Sociological social psychologists talked even more incessantly about the group, and sometimes attempted to treat it as a system in its own right.  But their theorizing tended to drift toward symbolic interactionism, or to rely very heavily upon static, structural concepts like position, status or power.  Left to themselves, I suspect the sociological types might have nourished the group more adequately, but they were usually outnumbered and outmaneuvered by their psychological brethren\" (Steiner 1974:101).\n\nBased on our analysis of group research published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005, we conclude that the \"sociological types\" have in fact nourished the group more adequately than their psychological brethren.  The index of interest in groups is much higher in SPQ than was found either by MHH in psychological social psychology or by Sanna and Parks in applied and organizational psychology journals.  Perhaps it is not surprising that sociologists would show more interest in groups.  Sociologists were the first to use the term \"small group,\" and introduced concepts like \"primary group,\" and \"face to face group\" (Moreno 1954:180).  Moreno was told by a friend, \"I'm glad that you always ran with the sociologists rather than the psychologists because it becomes increasingly apparent that the Ôgroup factorÕ is much more important in understanding human behavior to say nothing of predicting it than orthodox psychologists and even the unorthodox ones like Freud ever imagined\" (Moreno 1955a:7).  Unlike psychologists, sociologists have never been bogged down in debates about the reality of groups.  Sociologists see groups as the building blocks of society, and as microcosms of the larger social world.  In a recent call for sociologists to pay even more attention to groups, Harrington and Fine (2000:312) claim that the core issues of the discipline come together in small groups:  \"Small groups are the locus of both social control and social change, where networks are formed, culture is created, and status order is made concrete.\"  Whether sociologists will heed this call, and continue to surpass psychologistsÕ interest in groups remains to be seen.  We understand that Gwen M. Wittenbaum and Richard L. Moreland have recently extended MHH's research by examining group papers published from 1995 to 2006.  Their new data show that interest in groups in psychological social psychology journals has now climbed above 30% (Moreland, personal communication).\n\nSteiner was correct in believing that sociological social psychology tends to focus on topics related to group structure.  However, his characterization of structural concepts like status as being \"static\" is hardly accurate.  The \"dynamics\" of status is clearly shown in Ridgeway's (2006) research on the social construction of status beliefs.  Steiner was also wrong when he characterized group research in sociological social psychology as drifting toward symbolic interactionism.  The impact of SI on group papers published in SPQ has never been as strong as EST or exchange.  SI has grown in influence over the years, however, and did contribute to the revitalization of group research in the 1990s.\n\nIf there is any theoretical \"drifting\" to be found in SPQ , it is toward European and social cognition approaches.  The impact of social identity theory and social cognition can be seen in papers on a variety of topics, ranging from group composition (e.g., Kameda et al. 1992), to social influence (e.g., Bagozzi and Lee 2002), networks (McFarland and Pals 2005), justice (Wenzel 2004), public goods (Sell et al. 2002), and status (e.g., Oldmeadow et al. 2003).  Had intergroup relations and group performance been more popular topics in SPQ , the \"drift\" toward European and social cognition approaches would have been even more pronounced.\n\nBased on our research, we conclude that the study of groups in sociological social psychology is alive and doing much better than some had feared.  On average, about 31% of SPQ is devoted to groups.  Interest in groups appears recently to have dropped somewhat below average, but it is too early to know whether this trend will continue.  The \"call for papers\" on the topic of \"small groups in social life\" issued in SPQ in March 2007 may indicate a promising future for group research in its pages.  The increasing collaboration and international diversity of authors is also encouraging.  The prominence of women in the lists of most productive authors and most influential papers is impressive.  These are signs of vigor and engagement.  The fact that all of the most productive authors are sociologists, however, suggests that group research in SPQ is more specialized than interdisciplinary in nature.  Somewhat troubling is the persistence of single study publications in SPQ , when other journals like Journal of Personality and Social Psychology are averaging over two studies per paper (Quinones-Vidal et al. 2004).  Single study publications in SPQ might be explained by less thorough training in experimental methods and less of a commitment to incremental research on the part of sociologists.  Or, it might be explained by structural constraints that sociologists who do experimental research often face, like the lack of access to laboratory space and the absence of organized \"subject pools.\"  Only with an equipped lab, an abundance of participants, and a team of colleagues and graduate students can researchers manage to complete and publish multiple studies at a time.  Threats to research productivity, and lack of interdisciplinary appeal may challenge the future of group research in sociological social psychology.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nAdair, John G. and Neharika Vohra.  2003.  \"The Explosion of Knowledge, References, and Citations: Psychology's Unique Response to a Crisis.\" American Psychologist 58:15-23.\n\nAlessio, John C. 1980. \"Another Folly for Equity Theory.\" Social Psychology Quarterly 43:336340.\n\nBagozzi, Richard P. and Kyu-Hyun Lee.  2002.  \"Multiple Routes for Social Influence: The Role of Compliance, Internalization and Social Identity.\" Social Psychology Quarterly 65:226-47.\n\nBales, Robert F.  1958.  \"Task Roles and Social Roles in Problem-Solving Groups.\"  Pp. 437-47 in Readings in Social Psychology , 3 rd Edition, edited by Eleanor E.

We identified a total of 332 papers about groups published during the time period.  Following Moreland, Hogg, and Hains (1994), we created an index of interest in groups by dividing the number of pages in papers about groups by the total number of journal pages. Results show that interest in groups in SPQ generally fell from the late 1970s through the 1980s, rose during most of the 1990s, but stalled in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  In 2005 interest in groups hovered just under the 31-year average.  We examined the impact of European and social cognition approaches, expectation states theory, social exchange theory, and symbolic interactionism on these trends.  The most popular topic of research is group structure.  The most common research method is the laboratory experiment.  Papers about groups have increased in length, number of references, and number of authors.  Most papers report a single study.  The most productive authors and most influential papers are identified.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nSocial psychologists have always been interested in groups.  In the early 1970s, however, Ivan Steiner noticed a drop in the level of social psychologists' interest.  In his famous paper, \"Whatever Happened to the Group in Social Psychology?\" Steiner hypothesized that a period of social tranquility decreases social psychological interest in groups:  \"My point is that when society is serene, and only a few wrong-headed deviants disturb our tranquility, we focus our attention on individuals or on large organizations.  But when many small segments of society are vying with one another, our attention is drawn to units of intermediate size\" (Steiner 1974:105). Steiner predicted that a period of social unrest would produce an upward trend in social psychologists' publications about groups (with a possible lag of 8 to 10 years), whereas a period of social calm would produce a downward trend.  He noted that the Great Depression and WWII were times of turmoil, and they spawned a very \"groupy\" social psychology in the late 1940s and 1950s.  The 1950s were a time of tranquility, and that was followed by \"the hibernation of the group\" in the 1960s.  Because the 1960s and early 1970s were hardly tranquil times, Steiner predicted that by the late 1970s, \"the group will rise again!\"  However, by the 1980s it became clear that group dynamics was not becoming increasingly more popular, and Steiner (1983; 1986) twice revised his optimistic predictions.  Despite his frustration in predicting trends, Steiner did succeed in drawing attention to trends in social psychological publications about groups, and in making the study of these trends an interesting topic for research.\n\nSteiner described the \"groupy\" (versus individualistic) approach to research as looking for causes that are located outside the individual, that are located in the collective actions of others or in the constraints imposed by the larger system.  The individual is presumed to be part of a larger system, a small group, an organization, or society.  Fellow group members may or not be visible, but they help predict and explain behavior (Steiner 1974).  Steiner never collected empirical data on publication trends, and thus never provided an operational definition of group research.\n\nMoreland, Hogg, and Hains (1994) (henceforth referred to as MHH) were the first to collect data on publications about groups and test Steiner's hypothesis.  MHH at first thought it would be easy to identify papers about groups by simply looking for papers on classic topics like conformity or group decision-making, that reported data collected from several participants who interacted with each other.  They found many papers like that, but soon confronted some complications.  One complication was the issue of whether or not to include dyads in their definition of groups.  Others include dyads in their definition of groups (see Forsyth 2006), but MHH reasoned that dyads seem different from other groups in many ways, and that some phenomena that occur in groups (like coalition formation, majority/minority influence, and socialization) cannot occur in dyads at all.  MHH decided that \"most\" research on dyads should be excluded, with two kinds of exceptions.  In some papers on dyadic bargaining, the parties represented the interests of constituent groups, and these kinds of papers would be included.  In other papers, group behavior was studied using data collected, \"perhaps as a methodological convenience,\" from dyads.  These kinds of dyadic papers were included only if a \"clear interest in group phenomena was apparent\" (Moreland et al. 1994:531).  They cite Nyquist and Spence (1986) as an example of this kind of paper.  Nyquist and Spence studied the contribution of gender as a status characteristic to the determination of leadership choice in task-focused groups. The researchers paired male and female participants with high and low dispositional\n\n(personality) dominance, and found that men were more likely to assume leadership of mixed sex groups even when the men scored lower in dispositional dominance than their female partners.  Their method involved dyads but their theory focused on whether men possess more legitimate authority in task groups even when personality may dictate otherwise.  Furthermore, MHH did not limit their definition of group research only to studies of small, face-to-face, interacting groups.  MHH also included studies of stereotyping, prejudice, intergroup contact, and ingroup bias between members of racial, ethnic, or national groups.\n\nMHH studied group research published from 1975 to 1993 in psychological social psychology journals (i.e., Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , and Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin ).  Contrary to Steiner's predictions, MHH found that interest in groups continued to fall during the late 1970s, remained low in the 1980s, but rose again in the 1990s.  They concluded that developments within the field of social psychology itself, rather than levels of unrest in society, explain these trends.  In particular, they attributed the growing interest in groups in the 1990s to the growing popularity of European approaches (especially social identity theory) and to the growing popularity of social cognition theories and methods (e.g., stereotyping theories and implicit priming methods).  MHH content analyzed the papers about groups, and looked for trends in topics of interest.  Their results showed an enormous increase in interest in intergroup relations, making it the most popular topic in psychological social psychological studies of groups.  In contrast, intra-group topics were much less popular.  Interest in group performance had dropped significantly.  The study of group structure was even less popular.\n\nSanna and Parks (1997) were the next to study trends in publications about groups.  Given the focus on intergroup topics in psychological social psychology journals, Sanna and Parks proposed to find out, \"Whatever Happened to Intragroup Research?\"  They reasoned that a logical place to look for intra-group research would be applied and organizational psychology journals (i.e., Journal of Applied Psychology , Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes , and Academy of Management Journal ).  Sanna and Parks' study of publications from 1975 through 1994 showed that group performance is the most popular topic of group research in the applied and organizational literature.  They found negligible interest in intergroup relations. They also found negligible interest in the study of group structure.  Like MHH, Sanna and Parks found that interest in groups fell during the late 1970s, remained low in the 1980s, and rose again in the 1990s.  Sanna and Parks concluded that group publications rose in the 1990s in part because social psychologists with papers about intra-group processes started sending these kinds of papers to applied and organizational journals rather than to psychological social psychology journals.\n\n## WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GROUP RESEARCH IN SOCIOLOGICAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY?\n\nDespite the popularity of group research in sociological social psychology, neither MHH nor Sanna and Parks included sociologically oriented journals in their analysis.  A search of Web of Knowledge failed to uncover any published research examining trends in group research published in sociologically oriented journals.  If intergroup relations is the most popular topic in psychological social psychology, and if group performance is the most popular topic in applied\n\nand organizational psychology, then what is the most popular topic of group research in sociological social psychology?  We hypothesized that it would be the study of group structure. Sociological social psychology seems a likely place to find the study of group structure, given the history of its major journal, and the nature of its classic contributions to the study of groups.\n\nSociological social psychology inherited a focus on sociometry through the history of its major journal.  The American Sociological Association's major journal of social psychology, Social Psychology Quarterly ( SPQ ), started out in 1937 as Sociometry:  A Journal of Interpersonal Relations . Sociometry was founded by J. L. Moreno (first published as Sociometric Review in 1936), as an outlet for research combining \"socius-structure of the group\" and \"metrummeasurement\" (Moreno 1955b:17).  At that time, Sociometry was not a sociology journal, but an interdisciplinary journal \"dealing with sociometric and near-sociometric small group research\" (Moreno 1954:186).  Its editor was a psychologist (Gardner Murphy), and its eclectic editorial board included psychiatrists and anthropologists (e.g., Margaret Mead).  Moreno believed Sociometry was more advanced than 1930s-style sociology (which he characterized as American \"armchair\" sociology) because his journal explored the dynamics of group structure with measurement instruments like the sociometric test, sociometric questionnaire, social distance scale, and sociogram (Moreno 1955b:15-16).\n\nMoreno, however, was closely associated with sociology, and belonged to the American Sociological Society.  When Moreno decided to step down as editor in 1955, he gave Sociometry to the American Sociological Society.  The journal's name changed to Sociometry:  Journal of Research in Social Psychology in 1956, and the new editors broadened the scope of the journal to focus on \"the systematic exploration of the processes and products of social interaction at the interpersonal, intrapersonal, intergroup and intragroup levels\" (Editorial 1956).  In 1978 Sociometry changed its name to Social Psychology and in 1979 to Social Psychology Quarterly . The purpose of the journal's name change was to reflect more accurately the broad field of theory and research in social psychology.  Nevertheless, the journal continued (as stated on the inside cover) to publish \"articles concerning the processes and products of social interaction,\" suggesting that studies of group structure would still find a home.  The journal further broadened its scope in 1988 (as stated on the inside cover) to \"publishing papers on the link between the individual and society,\" but it continued with the tradition of welcoming sociometric research (e.g., Hallinan and Kubitschek 1990).\n\nFurthermore, many of the classic (non-sociometric) contributions to group research by sociologists have focused on group structure, and the pages of SPQ show that these classic contributions continue to influence sociological research today.  Robert Bales (1958) examined roles and role differentiation in small groups.  Berger, Cohen and Zelditch (1972) examined status characteristics and social interaction.  The continuing impact of these classic contributions can be found in contemporary research on roles and statuses in groups (e.g., Van Rossem and Vermande 2004; Whitmeyer, Webster, and Rashotte 2005).  George C. Homans (1958) examined patterns of social exchange and distributive justice in groups.  The impact of his ideas can be found in contemporary research on exchange networks and on social justice (e.g., Hegtvedt and Johnson 2000; Walker et al. 2000).  The early symbolic interactionists were also interested in group structure (Shalin 1986).  Thrasher (1927) and Whyte (1943) examined group structure as an emergent process in their studies of street gangs.  Other symbolic interactionists\n\n(e.g., Kuhn and McPartland 1954) studied group structure as a pre-existing, organized, stable pattern of interaction on the basis of which individuals derive their sense of self, their definitions of the situation, and their choice of modes of conduct.  The ideas of early symbolic interactionists continue to influence contemporary research focusing on group structure (e.g., Jimerson 1999; Troyer, Younts, and Kalkhoff 2001).\n\nHistory, then, suggests that sociological social psychology should have an active program of group research, specializing in the topic of group structure.  On the other hand, some contemporary researchers have expressed concern about a decline in group research in sociology (Harrington and Fine 2000; Burke 2003).  If this were the case, it would be problematic indeed, as the study of groups in one of the pillars of sociological social psychology (Delamater 2003:xi).  Although sociological social psychologists may express concern about the demise of the study of groups, we were unable to find any quantitative analysis that would indicate if their fears were justified.  Hence, we set out to conduct some research of our own.  We decided to examine papers published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005. SPQ is not the only sociologically oriented journal of social psychology, but it is the flagship journal of sociological social psychology.  It seemed to us to be the best place to find trends in sociologically oriented group research.  In Study One, our goal was to adopt the methodology of MHH to study trends in group research in SPQ .  In Study Two, we intended to characterize the nature of group research published in SPQ , using some basic bibliometric methods.\n\n## STUDY ONE\n\nIn this study we examined trends in the popularity of group research, determined what are the most common topics and methods, and tried to identify the most important theoretical influences. Data come from papers published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005.  We compare our results with those found in previous research.\n\n## Method\n\nWe examined every paper published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005 (including awards, book reviews, and comments), and identified the papers about groups.  Most of the papers about groups involved the direct study of naturally occurring or experimentally formed groups.  For instance, we found observational and survey research on naturally occurring groups such as football teams (Rees and Segal 1984), classrooms (Hallinan 1979), dormitory residents (MacNeil, Davis, and Pace 1975), sororities (Paxton and Moody 2003), juries (Manzo 1996), and therapy groups (McCarrick, Manderscheid, and Silbergeld 1981).  We also found studies of ad hoc experimental groups in papers about N-person prisonerÕs dilemmas (Bonachich 1976), choice shifts (Hong, 1978), social exchange (Simpson and Borch 2005), and coalition formation (Komorita and Brinberg 1977).  In some cases, the experimental groups included confederates or simulated partners (e.g., Kaplan 1977).\n\nNeither the research method nor the number of participants, however, was a decisive factor in determining whether the paper was about groups.  For instance, some theoretical papers (e.g., Harrington and Fine 2000) and some comments (e.g., Nemeth 1983) were about groups, despite the fact that they did not involve the direct study of any participants.  Other papers about groups\n\ninvolved the direct study of individuals.  This was especially true of experimental and survey research about intergroup relations, on topics such as social identity (Ellmers, Van Dyck, Hinkle, and Jacobs 2000), stereotyping (Gaertner and McLaughlin 1983), or contact (Stephan 1977). Likewise, papers involving the direct study of dyads could be about groups.  In some cases the dyads were categorized into groups (Yamagishi and Kiyonari 2000), or the dyads were representatives of groups (Insko, Schopler, Kennedy, and Dahl 1992).  In other cases, the researchers used dyads as a methodological convenience to test a theory about groups.  For instance, Ridgeway, Diekema and Johnson (1995) studied the legitimacy of hierarchy in peer groups.  In the theory section of their paper, the authors make it clear that the topic is about groups.  They define peer groups as homogeneous interactional groups whose members do not obviously differ in external status characteristics or established skill levels.  They give an example by adding that, Òinformal groups among people working at the same job or among students are often peer groups of this typeÓ (p. 298).  In the methods section of the paper, the authors make it clear that they studied dyads as a methodological convenience.  The authors explain that they needed to create task-oriented groups with emergent influence hierarchies, and that Òto accomplish this in the simplest way, we formed task-oriented dyads of one confederate and one na·ve subjectÓ (p. 303).  Because a Òclear interest in group phenomena was apparent,Ó we included this dyadic paper in the category of group research, following MHHÕs guidelines.\n\nAlso following MHHÕs guidelines, we did not count dyadic papers as being about groups if they focused particularly on dyads, and were not just using dyads as a methodological convenience to test a theory about groups.  Most of the papers eliminated on this basis were either about romantic couples (e.g., Schafer and Keith 1980; Cast 2003) or about dyadic models of equity (e.g., Moschetti 1979, 1982; Alessio 1980) or social exchange (e.g., Molm 1979a, 1979b, 1980, 1981a, and 1981b).\n\nSocial exchange papers by Linda D. Molm illustrate our reasoning.  In a series of papers, Molm (1979a, 1979b, 1980, 1981a, and 1981b) tested hypotheses about reinforcement on behavior. Two participants, isolated from each other, sat in front of experimental consoles with three sets of stimulus lights, two response buttons, and a Òreinforcer panelÓ with lights and a counter indicating the sum of money earned.  Participants knew that the colored stimulus lights were associated with the patterns of button presses that would produce earnings, and they knew that at any phase of the experiment their earnings might depend upon their own responses, the other personÕs responses, or their joint response.  Participants did not know, however, what the reinforcement patterns or contingencies were.  Molm manipulated the amount of money earned by different responses (i.e., sequences of button pushes) across different stages of the experiments, and tested the impact of differential reinforcement contingencies on behavior. Since the theory (having to do with operant conditioning and reward contingencies) and the research paradigm specifically focused on dyadic behavior, we did not count these papers as being about groups.  Three later publications by Molm, however, we did count as being about groups.  In one, she studied dyads embedded in a 4-person exchange network with two simulated partners (Molm 1988); in a second paper, she studied single participants in a 4-person exchange network with three simulated partners (Molm 1994a); and in a third paper, she wrote a theoretical analysis about social exchange in networks and groups (Molm 1994b).\n\nOur classification of MolmÕs earlier social exchange publications as being specifically about dyads is consistent with Yamagishi and CookÕs (1993) assessment of social exchange research. They describe ÒtraditionalÓ social exchange theory as limited primarily to the analysis of dyadic exchange relations.  They say that in response to this limitation, researchers then Òlaunched a series of theoretical and empirical efforts to extend social exchange theory beyond the initial, fairly narrow dyadic perspectiveÓ (p. 235).  Yamagishi and Cook explain that the first avenue for extending social exchange theory beyond its dyadic perspective was to embed these relations in larger network structures (as Molm did in her later research).  Thus, Yamagishi and CookÕs description of ÒtraditionalÓ versus extended social exchange theory is consistent with our conclusion that MolmÕs earlier papers were about dyads but her later papers were about groups.\n\nWe collected data on the papers about groups following the methods and coding categories used by MHH.  We coded papers on the basis of their research methods and topics (see Appendix A for examples of articles from each of the topical areas).  We coded papers according to whether they reflected European or social cognition approaches utilizing the same parameters set by MHH.  Influence by a European approach was indicated in a paper by its discussion of and citations to minority influence or social representations theories by Moscovici and his colleagues, or to social identity and self categorization theories by Tajfel and Turner, and their colleagues.  Nationality of the paper's authors played no part in the determination of European influence.  Influence by a social cognition approach was indicated by a paper's discussion of and citations to any attribution theory, or any theory of cognitive structure or process (e.g., cognitive balance, cognitive consistency, attitudes, heuristics).  Also included in the social cognition approach were papers that included self theory and the measurement of self (e.g., self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-concept).  Finally, papers reporting use of any cognitive method (e.g., recall, priming, response latency, implicit association) were counted as being influenced the social cognition approach.\n\nIn addition to following MHH's coding strategies, we also wanted to examine the possible influences of theories identified by Delamater (2003) as ÒbasicÓ to contemporary sociological social psychology.  Delamater identified five such basic theoretical perspectives: symbolic interactionism (SI), social exchange, expectation states (EST), social structure and personality (SS&P), and evolutionary social psychology (ESP).  So in addition to coding papers on European and social cognition approaches, we also kept track of whether a paper was influenced by any of these five basic theories.  In our analysis, SI included classic, structural, and identity approaches, dramaturgy, and conversation analysis.  EST included status characteristics theory, status construction theory, and various theories about performance expectations based on rewards or interchange patterns. Social exchange theory included research on bargaining, coalitions, equity, distributive justice, economic sociology, and social dilemma/game theoretical research.  SS&P included theories about the impact of social stratification or social class on individual feelings, attitudes and behaviors particularly in school, work, family and health contexts; theories of modernity or social change as they impact psychological functioning; life course theories; and any other research elaborating on the work of Kohn and Schooler.  ESP included theories explaining human social behavior by characteristics humans share with other animals such as biological factors or ecological factors, and evolutionary perspectives on reproduction, aggression, or altruism.\n\nWe dummy coded papers (zero or one) for the influence of each of the two approaches and five theories.  Thus, it was possible for papers to be influenced by any combination of approaches and theories, or to be influenced by none at all.  Most papers (76%) were influenced by at least one of the approaches or theories (see Appendix B for examples of articles influenced by the approaches and theories).\n\nTo assess the reliability of judgments about group research, one of us (Welch) independently evaluated 103 papers randomly selected out of the 1,037 papers evaluated by another one of us (Harrod).  We achieved 98% agreement in our evaluations of whether a paper is about groups. This yielded a Cohen's kappa value of .96.  To asses the reliability of other judgments, one of us (Welch) independently evaluated 33 papers randomly selected out of the subset of (332) group papers evaluated by another one of us (Harrod).  In judging European approach, we achieved 97% agreement, and this yielded a Cohen's kappa of value of .83.  The percentage of agreement and the Cohen's kappa value for other judgments are as follows:  social cognition approach, 94% and .85;  EST, 97% and .83;  exchange theory, 100% agreement;  SI, 97% and .87;  research method, 94% and .92;  and topic, 90% and .89.  These are good reliability levels.  One of us (Harrod) then coded papers for the influence of SS&P and ESP.\n\n## Results\n\nWe identified 332 papers about groups out of the 1,037 papers published from 1975 to 2005. The number of papers about groups per year reached a low of 2 in 1987, and a high of 19 in 1976, with an average of 10.7 per year.  Following MHH, we counted the number of pages in papers about groups and divided that number by the total number of pages in all papers in the journal to construct an \"index of interest in groups.\"  Figure 1 shows the index of interest in groups in SPQ from 1975 to 2005.  This index ranges from a low of 5.1% in 1987 to a high of 54.9% in 1995, with an average of 31.2%.  Data from psychological social psychology journals (reconstructed with permission from Richard Moreland), and from applied and organizational psychology journals (reconstructed with permission from Lawrence Sanna and Craig Parks) are shown in the bottom of Figure 1.  In comparison to these other journals, SPQ has a much higher level of interest in groups.  In every year except 1987 (which included a special issue on language), SPQ published relatively more pages of papers on groups than did the psychological journals.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/psychopdf/images/tmp2igvqxoq_image_1.png)\n\nWe performed a number of polynomial regressions to test for linear, quadratic, and cubic effects of years on index of interest.  We found that a cubic regression equation best describes the data, F (3,30) = 3.57, p < .03, with an R 2 of about 28%, and a Durbin-Watson statistic of 2.01, indicating little serial correlation among adjacent residuals.  The trendline is shown in Figure 1. It indicates that in SPQ interest in groups generally fell through the late 1970s and 1980s, rose into the 1990s, but stalled in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  In 2005, interest in groups hovered under the 31-year average.\n\nFollowing MHH, we looked for changes in the popularity of the social psychological approaches and theories to explain these trends.  We constructed measures of popularity by counting the number of pages in papers about groups influenced by each approach and theory, and divided those numbers by the total number of pages in all papers in the journal.  After determining popularity by year, we tested for linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic trends.  Results are shown in Figure 2.  The popularity of European and social cognition approaches are best represented by upward linear trends, whereas the popularity of EST, exchange, and SI are best represented by quartic, cubic, and linear trends, respectively.  On average, social cognition and EST have been the most popular theoretical perspectives in group papers in SPQ .  Group papers about social cognition made up 9.94% of all pages published in SPQ during the 31-year period, and group papers about EST made up 9.20%.\n\nThe popularity of SS&P and ESP are not shown in Figure 2 because we found too few group papers influenced by these theories to justify trend analysis.  Only 8 group papers were\n\ninfluenced by SS&P and only 5 by ESP in the 31-year period.  With most years showing zero popularity, we decided that the influence of SS&P and ESP could not help explain trends in the popularity of group research.  Therefore, we dropped consideration of the influence of SS&P and ESP from further analysis.\n\nFigure 2 Trends in the popularity of approaches and theories in SPQ\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/psychopdf/images/tmp2igvqxoq_image_2.png)\n\nFollowing MHH, we subtracted the pages associated with the approaches and theories from the overall index of interest in groups, and re-estimated trends in order to understand which perspectives contributed most to the observed increase in popularity of group research during the 1990s.  Figure 3 shows that a rejuvenation of interest in groups in the 1990s would not have taken place without the contribution of European and social cognition approaches.  Figure 3 shows the cubic trendline for the overall index of interest in groups in SPQ , along with the reestimated trendline after taking out pages in papers influenced by social cognition, and after taking out pages in papers influenced by the European approach.  Without either of these approaches, interest in groups would have continued to fall well into the 1990s before starting a slow, partial recovery.  Without the European or the social cognition approaches, the average index of interest in groups across the 31-year period would have been reduced from 31.2% to 23.3% and 21.3%, respectively.\n\n3 Influence of approaches and theories on nnterest nn groups nn SPQ Figurc\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/psychopdf/images/tmp2igvqxoq_image_3.png)\n\nFigure 3 also shows that SI, exchange, and EST each played a role in reviving interest in groups in the 1990s.  The index of interest in groups would not have been reduced very much before the 1990s if papers about SI were subtracted.  After that point, however, removing pages inspired by SI would noticeably pull down the interest in groups.  Over the 31-year period, the average index of interest in groups would have been reduced to 27.0% without the influence of SI.  Social exchange theory played an even bigger role than SI in supporting group research, particularly starting in the late 1980s.  Without papers inspired by exchange, interest in groups would have fallen through most of the 1990s, and the average index of interest in groups would have been reduced to 23.6%.  EST had an even bigger impact.  Without the influence of EST, interest in groups would have continued to go down across the 31-year period.  There would have been no revival starting in the 1990s.  By the late 1990s group research would have been in the doldrums. Without papers inspired by EST, the average index of interest in groups would be 22.0%.\n\nThe research methods used in papers about groups are shown in Table 1.  Laboratory experiments account for almost half of the research methods in the group papers published in SPQ .  This is substantially lower than the popularity of lab experiments found in group publications in psychological social psychology journals, but comparable to that found in applied and organizational psychology journals. SPQ publishes more group research using surveys than the other journals. SPQ publishes substantially more papers using \"other\" methods, including commentaries, awards, and editorial introductions.\n\nTable 1.

The psychological social psychology journals evaluated were Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , and Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin for the years 1975-1993 (Moreland et al. 1994).  The applied/organizational psychology journals evaluated were the Journal of Applied Psychology , Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes , and Academy of Management Journal for the years 1975-1994 (Sanna and Parks 1997).  The evaluation of SPQ was for the years 1975-2005.\n\nThe topics addressed in papers about groups are shown in Table 2.  As expected, group structure is the most popular topic in the papers published in SPQ .  A substantially greater proportion of papers about group structure are published in SPQ than are published in either psychological social psychology or applied and organizational psychology journals.  Intergroup relations is somewhat popular in SPQ , but much less so than in the psychological social psychology journals.  Perhaps the most surprising finding in Table 2 is the relative neglect of group performance in the pages of SPQ .  Group performance is either the most or second most popular topic in the psychological journals, but it appears to get short shrift in SPQ .\n\nTable 2.

These data show that group structure has been and continues to be the single most popular topic of group research in SPQ .  Group structure dipped somewhat in popularity during the periods 1985 to 1989 and 1990 to 1994, when this topic accounted for 35% and 26.2% of all pages in papers about groups, respectively.  However, group structure shot back up in popularity during the period 1990 to 1994, accounting for an impressive 51.1% of all pages in papers about groups.  Table 3 shows that interest in social dilemmas and power appears to have increased, but interest in bargaining and coalitions, and in minority/majority influence has gone down.  Interest in every aspect of group performance has gone down.  In the area of intergroup relations, only the topic of social identity appears to be growing in popularity.\n\nTable 3.

The level of interest in groups, however, does not seem to respond to levels of unrest in society as Steiner predicted.  The 1960s and 1970s were times of social unrest in American society, but the popularity of groups in SPQ fell in the late 1970s and remained low through the 1980s.  The 1980s were a period of social calm in America, but the popularity of groups in SPQ increased in the 1990s.  Whether terrorist attacks or the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will eventually boost interest in groups is unknown, but recent interest in groups appears to be hovering below the 31year average.\n\nInterest in groups in SPQ does seem to be explained by developments in the field of social psychology.  The two developments that MHH claimed to have boosted interest in groups in psychological social psychology also seem to have boosted interest in groups in sociological social psychology.  These are the growing popularity of European approaches (especially social identity theory) and the growing popularity of social cognition.  These approaches pulled group research out of a decline in psychology, and apparently did so in sociology as well.\n\nThe popularity of group research in SPQ , however, can also be explained closer to home by developments within the field of sociology itself.  Our data show that Berger was correct in 1992 when he said, \"Within the past few years, I believe we have witnessed the emergence (or reemergence) of the Ônew group process movement':  social psychologists in sociology who are concerned with research and theory on interpersonal or group processes and structures\" (Berger 1992:9).  Group research had indeed started to take off by the 1990s.  Our data show that Berger was also correct in identifying two of the biggest contributors to the resurgence in popularity of group research in the 1990s:  exciting new developments in exchange theory (stimulated by the work of Karen Cook, Linda Molm, Toshio Yamagishi, Jane Sell, and others) and in EST (stimulated by the work of James Balkwell, Cecilia Ridgeway, and others).  Although not as apparent in 1992 when Berger commented on the field, SI would also play a role in the reemergence group research.  Ethnographic studies of existing groups (for instance by Fine, Cahill, Lois, Jimerson, and others) became more common in SPQ .\n\nThe topic of group structure is neglected in psychological social psychology and in applied and organizational psychology, but it is the major topic of interest in SPQ .  In other words, the topic of group structure characterizes not just the classic but also the contemporary contributions of sociologists to the understanding of small groups.  Remarkably, however, the study of structure has not been accompanied by the study of function.  Relatively little group research published in SPQ has focused on the quality or quantity of group performance.  Also surprising for a sociologically oriented journal is the relative lack of research published on the topic of intergroup conflict.  Hunt et al. (2000) content analyzed papers published in SPQ according to whether they dealt with race/ethnicity.  They found a surprising lack of research on this topic. Our data seem to echo their findings.\n\n## STUDY TWO\n\nOur goal in Study Two was to characterize the nature of group research published in SPQ , from 1975 to 2005, using some basic bibliometric methods.  Bibliometric methods refer to the quantification of bibliographic information such as authors, references, and citations. Bibliometric analysis answers questions such as who are the most prolific authors and which are the most influential studies?  Bibliometric analysis can also be used to gauge the scientific progress of a field of research (e.g., Qui-ones-Vidal et al. 2004).\n\n## Method\n\nWe used the dataset of 332 papers described in Study One.  In this dataset, we collected information about the number of authors and number of studies per paper, the national affiliation of first authors, number of references, and the methods and topics of papers.  We also obtained\n\ninformation from the Web of Science, using the \"advanced search\" option.  We selected \"Social Sciences Citation Index,\" and typed in the search box, \"SO = Sociometry or SO = Social Psychology or SO = Social Psychology Quarterly\" to find papers from our source journal under its three names.  We selected \"all documents.\"  After clicking on the results, we used the \"publication years\" tool to click on years 1975 to 2005, and then clicked on \"view records.\"  This procedure gave us the list of all papers published in the journal from 1975 to 2005.  We used the \"analyze\" by \"author\" options to create a list of the most productive authors, and used the data set we had created in Study One to verify how many of each author's papers were about groups. We used the \"citation report\" tool to get a list of the most cited papers, and again we used the data set we had created in Study One to verify whether or not each paper was about groups.\n\n## Results\n\nTable 4 shows the most productive authors of group research published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005 (based on our definition of group research as explained in Study One).  Almost all of these authors study topics related to status or social exchange.  All except one (Yamagishi) have American institutional affiliations.  Four of the top ten authors are women.  Table 5 shows the most influential (in terms of citations) group papers published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005 (based on our definition of group research as explained in Study One).  These data must be interpreted with caution.  Citation counts are often inaccurate (especially when authors list their names differently or when citations are incomplete or faulty).  Citation counts do not indicate the quality of a paper.  Older papers and review articles generally have more citations.  Among the most productive group authors, Yamagishi has three of the most influential group papers, Cook has one (coauthored with Yamagishi), and Hallinan has one.  Ten out of the 21 most influential papers are authored or coauthored by women.  The most frequent topics are group structure (6 papers), intergroup relations (6 papers), and social dilemmas (3 papers).  The most common methods are experiments (11 papers) and field studies (6 papers).\n\nTable 4.

Data on authorship show increasing levels of collaboration and international diversity in the publications about groups.  Linear regression shows that the average number of authors per paper has increased significantly over the years, F (1,331) = 9.75, p < .003.  The percentage of single authored papers is down.  The percentage of first authors from North America has fallen significantly across the time periods shown, Chi Square = 25.26, df. =12, p =.0136.  Data on papers show that they are getting longer.  The average number of pages per paper has increased across the years, F (1,331) = 72.82, p <.0001, as has the average number of references, F (1,331) = 114.06, p <.0001.  The average number of studies per paper, however, has not increased, and the percentage of single study papers has not gone down.  The proportion of papers reporting experiments, surveys, or other methods has significantly changed over the time periods shown, Chi Square = 25.26, df . = 12, p = .0136.  Surveys have increased and experiments have decreased in usage.\n\nTable 6.

Intergroup relations is a topic of influential papers, but is not studied by the most productive authors.  Descriptive data on authorship and papers show a mixed picture of \"scientific maturity.\"  On the one hand, increasing collaboration and international diversity among authors\n\nis a favorable sign.  Qui-ones-Vidal et al. (2004) point out that the highest levels of collaboration are found in the \"hard sciences\" and the lowest in the humanities.  Collaboration is an indicator of \"scientific maturity\" because it suggests the existence of synergistic teamwork, an established program of research, external funding, and a pipeline of dissertations and journal publications. Single authors simply cannot be as productive as research teams.  On the other hand, the complexity and rigor of group research does not appear to be increasing.  Most articles still report a single study, and the use of nonexperimental methods has somewhat increased.  The papers are longer and the list of references has increased, but the explanation for these trends is unclear (see Adair and Vohra 2003).\n\n## GENERAL DISCUSSION\n\nOur research is the first to characterize and analyze trends in group research published in sociological social psychology.  Our empirical findings can be compared to Steiner's unflattering characterization of the field of group research in sociology:\n\n\"Sociological social psychologists talked even more incessantly about the group, and sometimes attempted to treat it as a system in its own right.  But their theorizing tended to drift toward symbolic interactionism, or to rely very heavily upon static, structural concepts like position, status or power.  Left to themselves, I suspect the sociological types might have nourished the group more adequately, but they were usually outnumbered and outmaneuvered by their psychological brethren\" (Steiner 1974:101).\n\nBased on our analysis of group research published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005, we conclude that the \"sociological types\" have in fact nourished the group more adequately than their psychological brethren.  The index of interest in groups is much higher in SPQ than was found either by MHH in psychological social psychology or by Sanna and Parks in applied and organizational psychology journals.  Perhaps it is not surprising that sociologists would show more interest in groups.  Sociologists were the first to use the term \"small group,\" and introduced concepts like \"primary group,\" and \"face to face group\" (Moreno 1954:180).  Moreno was told by a friend, \"I'm glad that you always ran with the sociologists rather than the psychologists because it becomes increasingly apparent that the Ôgroup factorÕ is much more important in understanding human behavior to say nothing of predicting it than orthodox psychologists and even the unorthodox ones like Freud ever imagined\" (Moreno 1955a:7).  Unlike psychologists, sociologists have never been bogged down in debates about the reality of groups.  Sociologists see groups as the building blocks of society, and as microcosms of the larger social world.  In a recent call for sociologists to pay even more attention to groups, Harrington and Fine (2000:312) claim that the core issues of the discipline come together in small groups:  \"Small groups are the locus of both social control and social change, where networks are formed, culture is created, and status order is made concrete.\"  Whether sociologists will heed this call, and continue to surpass psychologistsÕ interest in groups remains to be seen.  We understand that Gwen M. Wittenbaum and Richard L. Moreland have recently extended MHH's research by examining group papers published from 1995 to 2006.  Their new data show that interest in groups in psychological social psychology journals has now climbed above 30% (Moreland, personal communication).\n\nSteiner was correct in believing that sociological social psychology tends to focus on topics related to group structure.  However, his characterization of structural concepts like status as being \"static\" is hardly accurate.  The \"dynamics\" of status is clearly shown in Ridgeway's (2006) research on the social construction of status beliefs.  Steiner was also wrong when he characterized group research in sociological social psychology as drifting toward symbolic interactionism.  The impact of SI on group papers published in SPQ has never been as strong as EST or exchange.  SI has grown in influence over the years, however, and did contribute to the revitalization of group research in the 1990s.\n\nIf there is any theoretical \"drifting\" to be found in SPQ , it is toward European and social cognition approaches.  The impact of social identity theory and social cognition can be seen in papers on a variety of topics, ranging from group composition (e.g., Kameda et al. 1992), to social influence (e.g., Bagozzi and Lee 2002), networks (McFarland and Pals 2005), justice (Wenzel 2004), public goods (Sell et al. 2002), and status (e.g., Oldmeadow et al. 2003).  Had intergroup relations and group performance been more popular topics in SPQ , the \"drift\" toward European and social cognition approaches would have been even more pronounced.\n\nBased on our research, we conclude that the study of groups in sociological social psychology is alive and doing much better than some had feared.  On average, about 31% of SPQ is devoted to groups.  Interest in groups appears recently to have dropped somewhat below average, but it is too early to know whether this trend will continue.  The \"call for papers\" on the topic of \"small groups in social life\" issued in SPQ in March 2007 may indicate a promising future for group research in its pages.  The increasing collaboration and international diversity of authors is also encouraging.  The prominence of women in the lists of most productive authors and most influential papers is impressive.  These are signs of vigor and engagement.  The fact that all of the most productive authors are sociologists, however, suggests that group research in SPQ is more specialized than interdisciplinary in nature.  Somewhat troubling is the persistence of single study publications in SPQ , when other journals like Journal of Personality and Social Psychology are averaging over two studies per paper (Quinones-Vidal et al. 2004).  Single study publications in SPQ might be explained by less thorough training in experimental methods and less of a commitment to incremental research on the part of sociologists.  Or, it might be explained by structural constraints that sociologists who do experimental research often face, like the lack of access to laboratory space and the absence of organized \"subject pools.\"  Only with an equipped lab, an abundance of participants, and a team of colleagues and graduate students can researchers manage to complete and publish multiple studies at a time.

Harrod, Bridget K. Welch, & Jeff Kushkowski Iowa State University\n\n## ABSTRACT\n\nWe examined trends in group research published in Social Psychology Quarterly (SPQ) from 1975 to 2005.  We identified a total of 332 papers about groups published during the time period.  Following Moreland, Hogg, and Hains (1994), we created an index of interest in groups by dividing the number of pages in papers about groups by the total number of journal pages. Results show that interest in groups in SPQ generally fell from the late 1970s through the 1980s, rose during most of the 1990s, but stalled in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  In 2005 interest in groups hovered just under the 31-year average.  We examined the impact of European and social cognition approaches, expectation states theory, social exchange theory, and symbolic interactionism on these trends.  The most popular topic of research is group structure.  The most common research method is the laboratory experiment.  Papers about groups have increased in length, number of references, and number of authors.  Most papers report a single study.  The most productive authors and most influential papers are identified.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nSocial psychologists have always been interested in groups.  In the early 1970s, however, Ivan Steiner noticed a drop in the level of social psychologists' interest.  In his famous paper, \"Whatever Happened to the Group in Social Psychology?\" Steiner hypothesized that a period of social tranquility decreases social psychological interest in groups:  \"My point is that when society is serene, and only a few wrong-headed deviants disturb our tranquility, we focus our attention on individuals or on large organizations.  But when many small segments of society are vying with one another, our attention is drawn to units of intermediate size\" (Steiner 1974:105). Steiner predicted that a period of social unrest would produce an upward trend in social psychologists' publications about groups (with a possible lag of 8 to 10 years), whereas a period of social calm would produce a downward trend.  He noted that the Great Depression and WWII were times of turmoil, and they spawned a very \"groupy\" social psychology in the late 1940s and 1950s.  The 1950s were a time of tranquility, and that was followed by \"the hibernation of the group\" in the 1960s.  Because the 1960s and early 1970s were hardly tranquil times, Steiner predicted that by the late 1970s, \"the group will rise again!\"  However, by the 1980s it became clear that group dynamics was not becoming increasingly more popular, and Steiner (1983; 1986) twice revised his optimistic predictions.  Despite his frustration in predicting trends, Steiner did succeed in drawing attention to trends in social psychological publications about groups, and in making the study of these trends an interesting topic for research.\n\nSteiner described the \"groupy\" (versus individualistic) approach to research as looking for causes that are located outside the individual, that are located in the collective actions of others or in the constraints imposed by the larger system.  The individual is presumed to be part of a larger system, a small group, an organization, or society.  Fellow group members may or not be visible, but they help predict and explain behavior (Steiner 1974).  Steiner never collected empirical data on publication trends, and thus never provided an operational definition of group research.\n\nMoreland, Hogg, and Hains (1994) (henceforth referred to as MHH) were the first to collect data on publications about groups and test Steiner's hypothesis.  MHH at first thought it would be easy to identify papers about groups by simply looking for papers on classic topics like conformity or group decision-making, that reported data collected from several participants who interacted with each other.  They found many papers like that, but soon confronted some complications.  One complication was the issue of whether or not to include dyads in their definition of groups.  Others include dyads in their definition of groups (see Forsyth 2006), but MHH reasoned that dyads seem different from other groups in many ways, and that some phenomena that occur in groups (like coalition formation, majority/minority influence, and socialization) cannot occur in dyads at all.  MHH decided that \"most\" research on dyads should be excluded, with two kinds of exceptions.  In some papers on dyadic bargaining, the parties represented the interests of constituent groups, and these kinds of papers would be included.  In other papers, group behavior was studied using data collected, \"perhaps as a methodological convenience,\" from dyads.  These kinds of dyadic papers were included only if a \"clear interest in group phenomena was apparent\" (Moreland et al. 1994:531).  They cite Nyquist and Spence (1986) as an example of this kind of paper.  Nyquist and Spence studied the contribution of gender as a status characteristic to the determination of leadership choice in task-focused groups. The researchers paired male and female participants with high and low dispositional\n\n(personality) dominance, and found that men were more likely to assume leadership of mixed sex groups even when the men scored lower in dispositional dominance than their female partners.  Their method involved dyads but their theory focused on whether men possess more legitimate authority in task groups even when personality may dictate otherwise.  Furthermore, MHH did not limit their definition of group research only to studies of small, face-to-face, interacting groups.  MHH also included studies of stereotyping, prejudice, intergroup contact, and ingroup bias between members of racial, ethnic, or national groups.\n\nMHH studied group research published from 1975 to 1993 in psychological social psychology journals (i.e., Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , and Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin ).  Contrary to Steiner's predictions, MHH found that interest in groups continued to fall during the late 1970s, remained low in the 1980s, but rose again in the 1990s.  They concluded that developments within the field of social psychology itself, rather than levels of unrest in society, explain these trends.  In particular, they attributed the growing interest in groups in the 1990s to the growing popularity of European approaches (especially social identity theory) and to the growing popularity of social cognition theories and methods (e.g., stereotyping theories and implicit priming methods).  MHH content analyzed the papers about groups, and looked for trends in topics of interest.  Their results showed an enormous increase in interest in intergroup relations, making it the most popular topic in psychological social psychological studies of groups.  In contrast, intra-group topics were much less popular.  Interest in group performance had dropped significantly.  The study of group structure was even less popular.\n\nSanna and Parks (1997) were the next to study trends in publications about groups.  Given the focus on intergroup topics in psychological social psychology journals, Sanna and Parks proposed to find out, \"Whatever Happened to Intragroup Research?\"  They reasoned that a logical place to look for intra-group research would be applied and organizational psychology journals (i.e., Journal of Applied Psychology , Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes , and Academy of Management Journal ).  Sanna and Parks' study of publications from 1975 through 1994 showed that group performance is the most popular topic of group research in the applied and organizational literature.  They found negligible interest in intergroup relations. They also found negligible interest in the study of group structure.  Like MHH, Sanna and Parks found that interest in groups fell during the late 1970s, remained low in the 1980s, and rose again in the 1990s.  Sanna and Parks concluded that group publications rose in the 1990s in part because social psychologists with papers about intra-group processes started sending these kinds of papers to applied and organizational journals rather than to psychological social psychology journals.\n\n## WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GROUP RESEARCH IN SOCIOLOGICAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY?\n\nDespite the popularity of group research in sociological social psychology, neither MHH nor Sanna and Parks included sociologically oriented journals in their analysis.  A search of Web of Knowledge failed to uncover any published research examining trends in group research published in sociologically oriented journals.  If intergroup relations is the most popular topic in psychological social psychology, and if group performance is the most popular topic in applied\n\nand organizational psychology, then what is the most popular topic of group research in sociological social psychology?  We hypothesized that it would be the study of group structure. Sociological social psychology seems a likely place to find the study of group structure, given the history of its major journal, and the nature of its classic contributions to the study of groups.\n\nSociological social psychology inherited a focus on sociometry through the history of its major journal.  The American Sociological Association's major journal of social psychology, Social Psychology Quarterly ( SPQ ), started out in 1937 as Sociometry:  A Journal of Interpersonal Relations . Sociometry was founded by J. L. Moreno (first published as Sociometric Review in 1936), as an outlet for research combining \"socius-structure of the group\" and \"metrummeasurement\" (Moreno 1955b:17).  At that time, Sociometry was not a sociology journal, but an interdisciplinary journal \"dealing with sociometric and near-sociometric small group research\" (Moreno 1954:186).  Its editor was a psychologist (Gardner Murphy), and its eclectic editorial board included psychiatrists and anthropologists (e.g., Margaret Mead).  Moreno believed Sociometry was more advanced than 1930s-style sociology (which he characterized as American \"armchair\" sociology) because his journal explored the dynamics of group structure with measurement instruments like the sociometric test, sociometric questionnaire, social distance scale, and sociogram (Moreno 1955b:15-16).\n\nMoreno, however, was closely associated with sociology, and belonged to the American Sociological Society.  When Moreno decided to step down as editor in 1955, he gave Sociometry to the American Sociological Society.  The journal's name changed to Sociometry:  Journal of Research in Social Psychology in 1956, and the new editors broadened the scope of the journal to focus on \"the systematic exploration of the processes and products of social interaction at the interpersonal, intrapersonal, intergroup and intragroup levels\" (Editorial 1956).  In 1978 Sociometry changed its name to Social Psychology and in 1979 to Social Psychology Quarterly . The purpose of the journal's name change was to reflect more accurately the broad field of theory and research in social psychology.  Nevertheless, the journal continued (as stated on the inside cover) to publish \"articles concerning the processes and products of social interaction,\" suggesting that studies of group structure would still find a home.  The journal further broadened its scope in 1988 (as stated on the inside cover) to \"publishing papers on the link between the individual and society,\" but it continued with the tradition of welcoming sociometric research (e.g., Hallinan and Kubitschek 1990).\n\nFurthermore, many of the classic (non-sociometric) contributions to group research by sociologists have focused on group structure, and the pages of SPQ show that these classic contributions continue to influence sociological research today.  Robert Bales (1958) examined roles and role differentiation in small groups.  Berger, Cohen and Zelditch (1972) examined status characteristics and social interaction.  The continuing impact of these classic contributions can be found in contemporary research on roles and statuses in groups (e.g., Van Rossem and Vermande 2004; Whitmeyer, Webster, and Rashotte 2005).  George C. Homans (1958) examined patterns of social exchange and distributive justice in groups.  The impact of his ideas can be found in contemporary research on exchange networks and on social justice (e.g., Hegtvedt and Johnson 2000; Walker et al. 2000).  The early symbolic interactionists were also interested in group structure (Shalin 1986).  Thrasher (1927) and Whyte (1943) examined group structure as an emergent process in their studies of street gangs.  Other symbolic interactionists\n\n(e.g., Kuhn and McPartland 1954) studied group structure as a pre-existing, organized, stable pattern of interaction on the basis of which individuals derive their sense of self, their definitions of the situation, and their choice of modes of conduct.  The ideas of early symbolic interactionists continue to influence contemporary research focusing on group structure (e.g., Jimerson 1999; Troyer, Younts, and Kalkhoff 2001).\n\nHistory, then, suggests that sociological social psychology should have an active program of group research, specializing in the topic of group structure.  On the other hand, some contemporary researchers have expressed concern about a decline in group research in sociology (Harrington and Fine 2000; Burke 2003).  If this were the case, it would be problematic indeed, as the study of groups in one of the pillars of sociological social psychology (Delamater 2003:xi).  Although sociological social psychologists may express concern about the demise of the study of groups, we were unable to find any quantitative analysis that would indicate if their fears were justified.  Hence, we set out to conduct some research of our own.  We decided to examine papers published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005. SPQ is not the only sociologically oriented journal of social psychology, but it is the flagship journal of sociological social psychology.  It seemed to us to be the best place to find trends in sociologically oriented group research.  In Study One, our goal was to adopt the methodology of MHH to study trends in group research in SPQ .  In Study Two, we intended to characterize the nature of group research published in SPQ , using some basic bibliometric methods.\n\n## STUDY ONE\n\nIn this study we examined trends in the popularity of group research, determined what are the most common topics and methods, and tried to identify the most important theoretical influences. Data come from papers published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005.  We compare our results with those found in previous research.\n\n## Method\n\nWe examined every paper published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005 (including awards, book reviews, and comments), and identified the papers about groups.  Most of the papers about groups involved the direct study of naturally occurring or experimentally formed groups.  For instance, we found observational and survey research on naturally occurring groups such as football teams (Rees and Segal 1984), classrooms (Hallinan 1979), dormitory residents (MacNeil, Davis, and Pace 1975), sororities (Paxton and Moody 2003), juries (Manzo 1996), and therapy groups (McCarrick, Manderscheid, and Silbergeld 1981).  We also found studies of ad hoc experimental groups in papers about N-person prisonerÕs dilemmas (Bonachich 1976), choice shifts (Hong, 1978), social exchange (Simpson and Borch 2005), and coalition formation (Komorita and Brinberg 1977).  In some cases, the experimental groups included confederates or simulated partners (e.g., Kaplan 1977).\n\nNeither the research method nor the number of participants, however, was a decisive factor in determining whether the paper was about groups.  For instance, some theoretical papers (e.g., Harrington and Fine 2000) and some comments (e.g., Nemeth 1983) were about groups, despite the fact that they did not involve the direct study of any participants.  Other papers about groups\n\ninvolved the direct study of individuals.  This was especially true of experimental and survey research about intergroup relations, on topics such as social identity (Ellmers, Van Dyck, Hinkle, and Jacobs 2000), stereotyping (Gaertner and McLaughlin 1983), or contact (Stephan 1977). Likewise, papers involving the direct study of dyads could be about groups.  In some cases the dyads were categorized into groups (Yamagishi and Kiyonari 2000), or the dyads were representatives of groups (Insko, Schopler, Kennedy, and Dahl 1992).  In other cases, the researchers used dyads as a methodological convenience to test a theory about groups.  For instance, Ridgeway, Diekema and Johnson (1995) studied the legitimacy of hierarchy in peer groups.  In the theory section of their paper, the authors make it clear that the topic is about groups.  They define peer groups as homogeneous interactional groups whose members do not obviously differ in external status characteristics or established skill levels.  They give an example by adding that, Òinformal groups among people working at the same job or among students are often peer groups of this typeÓ (p. 298).  In the methods section of the paper, the authors make it clear that they studied dyads as a methodological convenience.  The authors explain that they needed to create task-oriented groups with emergent influence hierarchies, and that Òto accomplish this in the simplest way, we formed task-oriented dyads of one confederate and one na·ve subjectÓ (p. 303).  Because a Òclear interest in group phenomena was apparent,Ó we included this dyadic paper in the category of group research, following MHHÕs guidelines.\n\nAlso following MHHÕs guidelines, we did not count dyadic papers as being about groups if they focused particularly on dyads, and were not just using dyads as a methodological convenience to test a theory about groups.  Most of the papers eliminated on this basis were either about romantic couples (e.g., Schafer and Keith 1980; Cast 2003) or about dyadic models of equity (e.g., Moschetti 1979, 1982; Alessio 1980) or social exchange (e.g., Molm 1979a, 1979b, 1980, 1981a, and 1981b).\n\nSocial exchange papers by Linda D. Molm illustrate our reasoning.  In a series of papers, Molm (1979a, 1979b, 1980, 1981a, and 1981b) tested hypotheses about reinforcement on behavior. Two participants, isolated from each other, sat in front of experimental consoles with three sets of stimulus lights, two response buttons, and a Òreinforcer panelÓ with lights and a counter indicating the sum of money earned.  Participants knew that the colored stimulus lights were associated with the patterns of button presses that would produce earnings, and they knew that at any phase of the experiment their earnings might depend upon their own responses, the other personÕs responses, or their joint response.  Participants did not know, however, what the reinforcement patterns or contingencies were.  Molm manipulated the amount of money earned by different responses (i.e., sequences of button pushes) across different stages of the experiments, and tested the impact of differential reinforcement contingencies on behavior. Since the theory (having to do with operant conditioning and reward contingencies) and the research paradigm specifically focused on dyadic behavior, we did not count these papers as being about groups.  Three later publications by Molm, however, we did count as being about groups.  In one, she studied dyads embedded in a 4-person exchange network with two simulated partners (Molm 1988); in a second paper, she studied single participants in a 4-person exchange network with three simulated partners (Molm 1994a); and in a third paper, she wrote a theoretical analysis about social exchange in networks and groups (Molm 1994b).\n\nOur classification of MolmÕs earlier social exchange publications as being specifically about dyads is consistent with Yamagishi and CookÕs (1993) assessment of social exchange research. They describe ÒtraditionalÓ social exchange theory as limited primarily to the analysis of dyadic exchange relations.  They say that in response to this limitation, researchers then Òlaunched a series of theoretical and empirical efforts to extend social exchange theory beyond the initial, fairly narrow dyadic perspectiveÓ (p. 235).  Yamagishi and Cook explain that the first avenue for extending social exchange theory beyond its dyadic perspective was to embed these relations in larger network structures (as Molm did in her later research).  Thus, Yamagishi and CookÕs description of ÒtraditionalÓ versus extended social exchange theory is consistent with our conclusion that MolmÕs earlier papers were about dyads but her later papers were about groups.\n\nWe collected data on the papers about groups following the methods and coding categories used by MHH.  We coded papers on the basis of their research methods and topics (see Appendix A for examples of articles from each of the topical areas).  We coded papers according to whether they reflected European or social cognition approaches utilizing the same parameters set by MHH.  Influence by a European approach was indicated in a paper by its discussion of and citations to minority influence or social representations theories by Moscovici and his colleagues, or to social identity and self categorization theories by Tajfel and Turner, and their colleagues.  Nationality of the paper's authors played no part in the determination of European influence.  Influence by a social cognition approach was indicated by a paper's discussion of and citations to any attribution theory, or any theory of cognitive structure or process (e.g., cognitive balance, cognitive consistency, attitudes, heuristics).  Also included in the social cognition approach were papers that included self theory and the measurement of self (e.g., self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-concept).  Finally, papers reporting use of any cognitive method (e.g., recall, priming, response latency, implicit association) were counted as being influenced the social cognition approach.\n\nIn addition to following MHH's coding strategies, we also wanted to examine the possible influences of theories identified by Delamater (2003) as ÒbasicÓ to contemporary sociological social psychology.  Delamater identified five such basic theoretical perspectives: symbolic interactionism (SI), social exchange, expectation states (EST), social structure and personality (SS&P), and evolutionary social psychology (ESP).  So in addition to coding papers on European and social cognition approaches, we also kept track of whether a paper was influenced by any of these five basic theories.  In our analysis, SI included classic, structural, and identity approaches, dramaturgy, and conversation analysis.  EST included status characteristics theory, status construction theory, and various theories about performance expectations based on rewards or interchange patterns. Social exchange theory included research on bargaining, coalitions, equity, distributive justice, economic sociology, and social dilemma/game theoretical research.  SS&P included theories about the impact of social stratification or social class on individual feelings, attitudes and behaviors particularly in school, work, family and health contexts; theories of modernity or social change as they impact psychological functioning; life course theories; and any other research elaborating on the work of Kohn and Schooler.  ESP included theories explaining human social behavior by characteristics humans share with other animals such as biological factors or ecological factors, and evolutionary perspectives on reproduction, aggression, or altruism.\n\nWe dummy coded papers (zero or one) for the influence of each of the two approaches and five theories.  Thus, it was possible for papers to be influenced by any combination of approaches and theories, or to be influenced by none at all.  Most papers (76%) were influenced by at least one of the approaches or theories (see Appendix B for examples of articles influenced by the approaches and theories).\n\nTo assess the reliability of judgments about group research, one of us (Welch) independently evaluated 103 papers randomly selected out of the 1,037 papers evaluated by another one of us (Harrod).  We achieved 98% agreement in our evaluations of whether a paper is about groups. This yielded a Cohen's kappa value of .96.  To asses the reliability of other judgments, one of us (Welch) independently evaluated 33 papers randomly selected out of the subset of (332) group papers evaluated by another one of us (Harrod).  In judging European approach, we achieved 97% agreement, and this yielded a Cohen's kappa of value of .83.  The percentage of agreement and the Cohen's kappa value for other judgments are as follows:  social cognition approach, 94% and .85;  EST, 97% and .83;  exchange theory, 100% agreement;  SI, 97% and .87;  research method, 94% and .92;  and topic, 90% and .89.  These are good reliability levels.  One of us (Harrod) then coded papers for the influence of SS&P and ESP.\n\n## Results\n\nWe identified 332 papers about groups out of the 1,037 papers published from 1975 to 2005. The number of papers about groups per year reached a low of 2 in 1987, and a high of 19 in 1976, with an average of 10.7 per year.  Following MHH, we counted the number of pages in papers about groups and divided that number by the total number of pages in all papers in the journal to construct an \"index of interest in groups.\"  Figure 1 shows the index of interest in groups in SPQ from 1975 to 2005.  This index ranges from a low of 5.1% in 1987 to a high of 54.9% in 1995, with an average of 31.2%.  Data from psychological social psychology journals (reconstructed with permission from Richard Moreland), and from applied and organizational psychology journals (reconstructed with permission from Lawrence Sanna and Craig Parks) are shown in the bottom of Figure 1.  In comparison to these other journals, SPQ has a much higher level of interest in groups.  In every year except 1987 (which included a special issue on language), SPQ published relatively more pages of papers on groups than did the psychological journals.\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/psychopdf/images/tmp2igvqxoq_image_1.png)\n\nWe performed a number of polynomial regressions to test for linear, quadratic, and cubic effects of years on index of interest.  We found that a cubic regression equation best describes the data, F (3,30) = 3.57, p < .03, with an R 2 of about 28%, and a Durbin-Watson statistic of 2.01, indicating little serial correlation among adjacent residuals.  The trendline is shown in Figure 1. It indicates that in SPQ interest in groups generally fell through the late 1970s and 1980s, rose into the 1990s, but stalled in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  In 2005, interest in groups hovered under the 31-year average.\n\nFollowing MHH, we looked for changes in the popularity of the social psychological approaches and theories to explain these trends.  We constructed measures of popularity by counting the number of pages in papers about groups influenced by each approach and theory, and divided those numbers by the total number of pages in all papers in the journal.  After determining popularity by year, we tested for linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic trends.  Results are shown in Figure 2.  The popularity of European and social cognition approaches are best represented by upward linear trends, whereas the popularity of EST, exchange, and SI are best represented by quartic, cubic, and linear trends, respectively.  On average, social cognition and EST have been the most popular theoretical perspectives in group papers in SPQ .  Group papers about social cognition made up 9.94% of all pages published in SPQ during the 31-year period, and group papers about EST made up 9.20%.\n\nThe popularity of SS&P and ESP are not shown in Figure 2 because we found too few group papers influenced by these theories to justify trend analysis.  Only 8 group papers were\n\ninfluenced by SS&P and only 5 by ESP in the 31-year period.  With most years showing zero popularity, we decided that the influence of SS&P and ESP could not help explain trends in the popularity of group research.  Therefore, we dropped consideration of the influence of SS&P and ESP from further analysis.\n\nFigure 2 Trends in the popularity of approaches and theories in SPQ\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/psychopdf/images/tmp2igvqxoq_image_2.png)\n\nFollowing MHH, we subtracted the pages associated with the approaches and theories from the overall index of interest in groups, and re-estimated trends in order to understand which perspectives contributed most to the observed increase in popularity of group research during the 1990s.  Figure 3 shows that a rejuvenation of interest in groups in the 1990s would not have taken place without the contribution of European and social cognition approaches.  Figure 3 shows the cubic trendline for the overall index of interest in groups in SPQ , along with the reestimated trendline after taking out pages in papers influenced by social cognition, and after taking out pages in papers influenced by the European approach.  Without either of these approaches, interest in groups would have continued to fall well into the 1990s before starting a slow, partial recovery.  Without the European or the social cognition approaches, the average index of interest in groups across the 31-year period would have been reduced from 31.2% to 23.3% and 21.3%, respectively.\n\n3 Influence of approaches and theories on nnterest nn groups nn SPQ Figurc\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/psychopdf/images/tmp2igvqxoq_image_3.png)\n\nFigure 3 also shows that SI, exchange, and EST each played a role in reviving interest in groups in the 1990s.  The index of interest in groups would not have been reduced very much before the 1990s if papers about SI were subtracted.  After that point, however, removing pages inspired by SI would noticeably pull down the interest in groups.  Over the 31-year period, the average index of interest in groups would have been reduced to 27.0% without the influence of SI.  Social exchange theory played an even bigger role than SI in supporting group research, particularly starting in the late 1980s.  Without papers inspired by exchange, interest in groups would have fallen through most of the 1990s, and the average index of interest in groups would have been reduced to 23.6%.  EST had an even bigger impact.  Without the influence of EST, interest in groups would have continued to go down across the 31-year period.  There would have been no revival starting in the 1990s.  By the late 1990s group research would have been in the doldrums. Without papers inspired by EST, the average index of interest in groups would be 22.0%.\n\nThe research methods used in papers about groups are shown in Table 1.  Laboratory experiments account for almost half of the research methods in the group papers published in SPQ .  This is substantially lower than the popularity of lab experiments found in group publications in psychological social psychology journals, but comparable to that found in applied and organizational psychology journals. SPQ publishes more group research using surveys than the other journals. SPQ publishes substantially more papers using \"other\" methods, including commentaries, awards, and editorial introductions.\n\nTable 1.

The psychological social psychology journals evaluated were Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , and Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin for the years 1975-1993 (Moreland et al. 1994).  The applied/organizational psychology journals evaluated were the Journal of Applied Psychology , Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes , and Academy of Management Journal for the years 1975-1994 (Sanna and Parks 1997).  The evaluation of SPQ was for the years 1975-2005.\n\nThe topics addressed in papers about groups are shown in Table 2.  As expected, group structure is the most popular topic in the papers published in SPQ .  A substantially greater proportion of papers about group structure are published in SPQ than are published in either psychological social psychology or applied and organizational psychology journals.  Intergroup relations is somewhat popular in SPQ , but much less so than in the psychological social psychology journals.  Perhaps the most surprising finding in Table 2 is the relative neglect of group performance in the pages of SPQ .  Group performance is either the most or second most popular topic in the psychological journals, but it appears to get short shrift in SPQ .\n\nTable 2.

These data show that group structure has been and continues to be the single most popular topic of group research in SPQ .  Group structure dipped somewhat in popularity during the periods 1985 to 1989 and 1990 to 1994, when this topic accounted for 35% and 26.2% of all pages in papers about groups, respectively.  However, group structure shot back up in popularity during the period 1990 to 1994, accounting for an impressive 51.1% of all pages in papers about groups.  Table 3 shows that interest in social dilemmas and power appears to have increased, but interest in bargaining and coalitions, and in minority/majority influence has gone down.  Interest in every aspect of group performance has gone down.  In the area of intergroup relations, only the topic of social identity appears to be growing in popularity.\n\nTable 3.

The level of interest in groups, however, does not seem to respond to levels of unrest in society as Steiner predicted.  The 1960s and 1970s were times of social unrest in American society, but the popularity of groups in SPQ fell in the late 1970s and remained low through the 1980s.  The 1980s were a period of social calm in America, but the popularity of groups in SPQ increased in the 1990s.  Whether terrorist attacks or the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will eventually boost interest in groups is unknown, but recent interest in groups appears to be hovering below the 31year average.\n\nInterest in groups in SPQ does seem to be explained by developments in the field of social psychology.  The two developments that MHH claimed to have boosted interest in groups in psychological social psychology also seem to have boosted interest in groups in sociological social psychology.  These are the growing popularity of European approaches (especially social identity theory) and the growing popularity of social cognition.  These approaches pulled group research out of a decline in psychology, and apparently did so in sociology as well.\n\nThe popularity of group research in SPQ , however, can also be explained closer to home by developments within the field of sociology itself.  Our data show that Berger was correct in 1992 when he said, \"Within the past few years, I believe we have witnessed the emergence (or reemergence) of the Ônew group process movement':  social psychologists in sociology who are concerned with research and theory on interpersonal or group processes and structures\" (Berger 1992:9).  Group research had indeed started to take off by the 1990s.  Our data show that Berger was also correct in identifying two of the biggest contributors to the resurgence in popularity of group research in the 1990s:  exciting new developments in exchange theory (stimulated by the work of Karen Cook, Linda Molm, Toshio Yamagishi, Jane Sell, and others) and in EST (stimulated by the work of James Balkwell, Cecilia Ridgeway, and others).  Although not as apparent in 1992 when Berger commented on the field, SI would also play a role in the reemergence group research.  Ethnographic studies of existing groups (for instance by Fine, Cahill, Lois, Jimerson, and others) became more common in SPQ .\n\nThe topic of group structure is neglected in psychological social psychology and in applied and organizational psychology, but it is the major topic of interest in SPQ .  In other words, the topic of group structure characterizes not just the classic but also the contemporary contributions of sociologists to the understanding of small groups.  Remarkably, however, the study of structure has not been accompanied by the study of function.  Relatively little group research published in SPQ has focused on the quality or quantity of group performance.  Also surprising for a sociologically oriented journal is the relative lack of research published on the topic of intergroup conflict.  Hunt et al. (2000) content analyzed papers published in SPQ according to whether they dealt with race/ethnicity.  They found a surprising lack of research on this topic. Our data seem to echo their findings.\n\n## STUDY TWO\n\nOur goal in Study Two was to characterize the nature of group research published in SPQ , from 1975 to 2005, using some basic bibliometric methods.  Bibliometric methods refer to the quantification of bibliographic information such as authors, references, and citations. Bibliometric analysis answers questions such as who are the most prolific authors and which are the most influential studies?  Bibliometric analysis can also be used to gauge the scientific progress of a field of research (e.g., Qui-ones-Vidal et al. 2004).\n\n## Method\n\nWe used the dataset of 332 papers described in Study One.  In this dataset, we collected information about the number of authors and number of studies per paper, the national affiliation of first authors, number of references, and the methods and topics of papers.  We also obtained\n\ninformation from the Web of Science, using the \"advanced search\" option.  We selected \"Social Sciences Citation Index,\" and typed in the search box, \"SO = Sociometry or SO = Social Psychology or SO = Social Psychology Quarterly\" to find papers from our source journal under its three names.  We selected \"all documents.\"  After clicking on the results, we used the \"publication years\" tool to click on years 1975 to 2005, and then clicked on \"view records.\"  This procedure gave us the list of all papers published in the journal from 1975 to 2005.  We used the \"analyze\" by \"author\" options to create a list of the most productive authors, and used the data set we had created in Study One to verify how many of each author's papers were about groups. We used the \"citation report\" tool to get a list of the most cited papers, and again we used the data set we had created in Study One to verify whether or not each paper was about groups.\n\n## Results\n\nTable 4 shows the most productive authors of group research published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005 (based on our definition of group research as explained in Study One).  Almost all of these authors study topics related to status or social exchange.  All except one (Yamagishi) have American institutional affiliations.  Four of the top ten authors are women.  Table 5 shows the most influential (in terms of citations) group papers published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005 (based on our definition of group research as explained in Study One).  These data must be interpreted with caution.  Citation counts are often inaccurate (especially when authors list their names differently or when citations are incomplete or faulty).  Citation counts do not indicate the quality of a paper.  Older papers and review articles generally have more citations.  Among the most productive group authors, Yamagishi has three of the most influential group papers, Cook has one (coauthored with Yamagishi), and Hallinan has one.  Ten out of the 21 most influential papers are authored or coauthored by women.  The most frequent topics are group structure (6 papers), intergroup relations (6 papers), and social dilemmas (3 papers).  The most common methods are experiments (11 papers) and field studies (6 papers).\n\nTable 4.

Data on authorship show increasing levels of collaboration and international diversity in the publications about groups.  Linear regression shows that the average number of authors per paper has increased significantly over the years, F (1,331) = 9.75, p < .003.  The percentage of single authored papers is down.  The percentage of first authors from North America has fallen significantly across the time periods shown, Chi Square = 25.26, df. =12, p =.0136.  Data on papers show that they are getting longer.  The average number of pages per paper has increased across the years, F (1,331) = 72.82, p <.0001, as has the average number of references, F (1,331) = 114.06, p <.0001.  The average number of studies per paper, however, has not increased, and the percentage of single study papers has not gone down.  The proportion of papers reporting experiments, surveys, or other methods has significantly changed over the time periods shown, Chi Square = 25.26, df . = 12, p = .0136.  Surveys have increased and experiments have decreased in usage.\n\nTable 6.

Intergroup relations is a topic of influential papers, but is not studied by the most productive authors.  Descriptive data on authorship and papers show a mixed picture of \"scientific maturity.\"  On the one hand, increasing collaboration and international diversity among authors\n\nis a favorable sign.  Qui-ones-Vidal et al. (2004) point out that the highest levels of collaboration are found in the \"hard sciences\" and the lowest in the humanities.  Collaboration is an indicator of \"scientific maturity\" because it suggests the existence of synergistic teamwork, an established program of research, external funding, and a pipeline of dissertations and journal publications. Single authors simply cannot be as productive as research teams.  On the other hand, the complexity and rigor of group research does not appear to be increasing.  Most articles still report a single study, and the use of nonexperimental methods has somewhat increased.  The papers are longer and the list of references has increased, but the explanation for these trends is unclear (see Adair and Vohra 2003).\n\n## GENERAL DISCUSSION\n\nOur research is the first to characterize and analyze trends in group research published in sociological social psychology.  Our empirical findings can be compared to Steiner's unflattering characterization of the field of group research in sociology:\n\n\"Sociological social psychologists talked even more incessantly about the group, and sometimes attempted to treat it as a system in its own right.  But their theorizing tended to drift toward symbolic interactionism, or to rely very heavily upon static, structural concepts like position, status or power.  Left to themselves, I suspect the sociological types might have nourished the group more adequately, but they were usually outnumbered and outmaneuvered by their psychological brethren\" (Steiner 1974:101).\n\nBased on our analysis of group research published in SPQ from 1975 to 2005, we conclude that the \"sociological types\" have in fact nourished the group more adequately than their psychological brethren.  The index of interest in groups is much higher in SPQ than was found either by MHH in psychological social psychology or by Sanna and Parks in applied and organizational psychology journals.  Perhaps it is not surprising that sociologists would show more interest in groups.  Sociologists were the first to use the term \"small group,\" and introduced concepts like \"primary group,\" and \"face to face group\" (Moreno 1954:180).  Moreno was told by a friend, \"I'm glad that you always ran with the sociologists rather than the psychologists because it becomes increasingly apparent that the Ôgroup factorÕ is much more important in understanding human behavior to say nothing of predicting it than orthodox psychologists and even the unorthodox ones like Freud ever imagined\" (Moreno 1955a:7).  Unlike psychologists, sociologists have never been bogged down in debates about the reality of groups.  Sociologists see groups as the building blocks of society, and as microcosms of the larger social world.  In a recent call for sociologists to pay even more attention to groups, Harrington and Fine (2000:312) claim that the core issues of the discipline come together in small groups:  \"Small groups are the locus of both social control and social change, where networks are formed, culture is created, and status order is made concrete.\"  Whether sociologists will heed this call, and continue to surpass psychologistsÕ interest in groups remains to be seen.  We understand that Gwen M. Wittenbaum and Richard L. Moreland have recently extended MHH's research by examining group papers published from 1995 to 2006.  Their new data show that interest in groups in psychological social psychology journals has now climbed above 30% (Moreland, personal communication).\n\nSteiner was correct in believing that sociological social psychology tends to focus on topics related to group structure.  However, his characterization of structural concepts like status as being \"static\" is hardly accurate.  The \"dynamics\" of status is clearly shown in Ridgeway's (2006) research on the social construction of status beliefs.  Steiner was also wrong when he characterized group research in sociological social psychology as drifting toward symbolic interactionism.  The impact of SI on group papers published in SPQ has never been as strong as EST or exchange.  SI has grown in influence over the years, however, and did contribute to the revitalization of group research in the 1990s.\n\nIf there is any theoretical \"drifting\" to be found in SPQ , it is toward European and social cognition approaches.  The impact of social identity theory and social cognition can be seen in papers on a variety of topics, ranging from group composition (e.g., Kameda et al. 1992), to social influence (e.g., Bagozzi and Lee 2002), networks (McFarland and Pals 2005), justice (Wenzel 2004), public goods (Sell et al. 2002), and status (e.g., Oldmeadow et al. 2003).  Had intergroup relations and group performance been more popular topics in SPQ , the \"drift\" toward European and social cognition approaches would have been even more pronounced.\n\nBased on our research, we conclude that the study of groups in sociological social psychology is alive and doing much better than some had feared.  On average, about 31% of SPQ is devoted to groups.  Interest in groups appears recently to have dropped somewhat below average, but it is too early to know whether this trend will continue.  The \"call for papers\" on the topic of \"small groups in social life\" issued in SPQ in March 2007 may indicate a promising future for group research in its pages.  The increasing collaboration and international diversity of authors is also encouraging.  The prominence of women in the lists of most productive authors and most influential papers is impressive.  These are signs of vigor and engagement.  The fact that all of the most productive authors are sociologists, however, suggests that group research in SPQ is more specialized than interdisciplinary in nature.  Somewhat troubling is the persistence of single study publications in SPQ , when other journals like Journal of Personality and Social Psychology are averaging over two studies per paper (Quinones-Vidal et al. 2004).  Single study publications in SPQ might be explained by less thorough training in experimental methods and less of a commitment to incremental research on the part of sociologists.  Or, it might be explained by structural constraints that sociologists who do experimental research often face, like the lack of access to laboratory space and the absence of organized \"subject pools.\"  Only with an equipped lab, an abundance of participants, and a team of colleagues and graduate students can researchers manage to complete and publish multiple studies at a time.  Threats to research productivity, and lack of interdisciplinary appeal may challenge the future of group research in sociological social psychology.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nAdair, John G. and Neharika Vohra.  2003.  \"The Explosion of Knowledge, References, and Citations: Psychology's Unique Response to a Crisis.\" American Psychologist 58:15-23.\n\nAlessio, John C. 1980. \"Another Folly for Equity Theory.\" Social Psychology Quarterly 43:336340.\n\nBagozzi, Richard P. and Kyu-Hyun Lee.  2002.  \"Multiple Routes for Social Influence: The Role of Compliance, Internalization and Social Identity.\" Social Psychology Quarterly 65:226-47.\n\nBales, Robert F.  1958.  \"Task Roles and Social Roles in Problem-Solving Groups.\"  Pp. 437-47 in Readings in Social Psychology , 3 rd Edition, edited by Eleanor E.

      "response": "The document outlines a research study that analyzes trends in group research published in the \"Social Psychology Quarterly\" (SPQ) from 1975 to 2005. Here are some key points regarding the publication data:\n\n1. **Total Papers Analyzed**: The study identified a total of 332 papers about groups published in SPQ during the specified time period.\n\n2. **Index of Interest in Groups**: The interest in groups was quantified by dividing the number of pages dedicated to group papers by the total number of pages published in the journal, leading to an average index of interest in groups of 31.2% over the examined years.\n\n3. **Trends Over Time**: \n   - Interest in groups generally declined from the late 1970s through the 1980s.\n   - It rose during most of the 1990s but stalled in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n   - The year 2005 showed interest levels hovering just below the 31-year average.\n\n4. **Publication Characteristics**:\n   - Papers have increased in length, number of references, and number of authors.\n   - Most papers reported a single study.\n   - The most common research method used in group papers was laboratory experiments, accounting for nearly half of the methods used in SPQ.\n\n5. **Data on Authors**: The research included bibliometric analysis:\n   - It noted a trend towards increasing collaboration among authors.\n   - The average number of authors per paper has significantly increased over the years.\n\n6. **Citations Analysis**: The study identified the most prolific authors and the most cited papers, which often focused on topics related to status or social exchange.\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive view of how group research has evolved within the field of social psychology as reflected in SPQ over three decades.

As a Master's student in Information Systems at Northeastern University with a strong background in data engineering, cloud platforms, and analytics, I am eager to contribute my expertise in building scalable data solutions that drive impactful decision-making.\n\nDuring my tenure as a Systems Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, I played a pivotal role in optimizing core banking operations for a large financial institution, managing data pipelines that processed over 450 million daily transactions. I developed real-time analytics dashboards, enhancing data-driven decision-making for 28,000+ branches and improving operational efficiency by 40%. Additionally, my experience implementing CI/ CD pipelines and optimizing SQL queries resulted in a 30% improvement in system performance.\n\nMy technical proficiency includes Python, SQL, Snowflake, DBT, and Apache Airflow, coupled with experience in cloud platforms such as AWS and Google Cloud. I have built end-to-end ETL pipelines, including a financial data pipeline leveraging Snowflake and DBT to process and analyze large-scale SEC financial statements. Furthermore, my experience working with document intelligence and automated data extraction aligns well with your focus on data democratization.\n\nWhat excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to collaborate with a team dedicated to building innovative data solutions. My strong analytical skills, problemsolving mindset, and ability to work cross-functionally make me a strong fit for this role.

It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the  list  being  primarily  based  on  the  ISO  standard  ISO  3166-1.  For  instance,  the  United  Kingdom  is considered  a  single  entity,  while  the  constituent  countries  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.119 billion as of 2024. [1]\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/CountrywisePopulationpdf/images/tmp93w2kbp__image_2.png)\n\n## Method\n\nFigures  used  in  this  chart  are  based  on  the  most  up-to-date  estimates  or  projections  by  the  national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2024 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\nBecause  the  compiled  figures  are  not  collected  at  the  same  time  in  every  country,  or  at  the  same  level  of  accuracy,  the  resulting  numerical  comparisons  may  create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union, [a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica. [2]\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n|     | Location                         | Population    | % of world   | Date        | Source

The European Union is a sui generis supranational union whose sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has 5.49% of the world's population - see \"Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface TGM table\" (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps0000 1/default/table?lang=en). European Commission.\n- b. According to UN estimates, India surpassed China by the end of April 2023. [4]\n- c. Refers to Mainland China; excludes China's special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\n- d. Includes the population of the India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.\n- e. Includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but excludes the territories of the United States.\n- f. Includes the population of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and GilgitBaltistan.\n- g. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics has a projection of 181 million for 2025, but this method derives from a base year of 2011. This same projection overcounted the population for 2022 by about 4.4 million. [13]\n- h. Includes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, administrative areas on the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia. The population does not include the four annexed Ukrainian oblasts. The Ukrainian government and most of the world's other states consider the Crimean Peninsula, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia parts of Ukraine's territory.\n- i. Includes the integral 18 regions of France (including 5 overseas departments and regions). Excludes France's 5 overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna, and the sui generis collectivity of New Caledonia, which are shown separately. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff) and Clipperton Island (an uninhabited state private property of France) are not listed at all due to their extraordinary nature.\n- j. Excludes the three British Crown Dependencies and the 14 British Overseas Territories, listed separately. Four British Overseas Territories are not listed due to their extraordinary nature. The four not listed are British Antarctic Territory (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff), the British Indian Ocean Territory (a military base), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (hosts only government officials and research station staff), and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (a military base where permanent residency is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus).\n- k. Includes Zanzibar.\n- l. Does not include the Rohingya people. Some regions were estimated by satellite. [34]\n- m. Includes the regions Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra and Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab, the disputed territory of Western Sahara administered by Morocco and excluding Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (see Western Sahara conflict).\n- n. Despite high reported precision, estimates vary widely. For 2024, the CIA gives an estimate of 40,121,552 [47] , while the UN gives an estimate of 42,045,000 [48] , based on the 1979 census and fertility, mortality and immigration estimates. [49] Official figure includes an estimated 1.5 million nomadic population.\n- o. Excludes the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine's de jure territory which is occupied by Russia (however, includes the Donbas region, partly occupied by Russia).\n- p. Excludes the external territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island."

It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the  list  being  primarily  based  on  the  ISO  standard  ISO  3166-1.  For  instance,  the  United  Kingdom  is considered  a  single  entity,  while  the  constituent  countries  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.119 billion as of 2024. [1]\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/CountrywisePopulationpdf/images/tmp93w2kbp__image_2.png)\n\n## Method\n\nFigures  used  in  this  chart  are  based  on  the  most  up-to-date  estimates  or  projections  by  the  national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2024 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\nBecause  the  compiled  figures  are  not  collected  at  the  same  time  in  every  country,  or  at  the  same  level  of  accuracy,  the  resulting  numerical  comparisons  may  create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union, [a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica. [2]\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n|     | Location                         | Population    | % of world   | Date        | Source

The European Union is a sui generis supranational union whose sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has 5.49% of the world's population - see \"Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface TGM table\" (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps0000 1/default/table?lang=en). European Commission.\n- b. According to UN estimates, India surpassed China by the end of April 2023. [4]\n- c. Refers to Mainland China; excludes China's special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\n- d. Includes the population of the India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.\n- e. Includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but excludes the territories of the United States.\n- f. Includes the population of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and GilgitBaltistan.\n- g. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics has a projection of 181 million for 2025, but this method derives from a base year of 2011. This same projection overcounted the population for 2022 by about 4.4 million. [13]\n- h. Includes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, administrative areas on the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia. The population does not include the four annexed Ukrainian oblasts. The Ukrainian government and most of the world's other states consider the Crimean Peninsula, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia parts of Ukraine's territory.\n- i. Includes the integral 18 regions of France (including 5 overseas departments and regions). Excludes France's 5 overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna, and the sui generis collectivity of New Caledonia, which are shown separately. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff) and Clipperton Island (an uninhabited state private property of France) are not listed at all due to their extraordinary nature.\n- j. Excludes the three British Crown Dependencies and the 14 British Overseas Territories, listed separately. Four British Overseas Territories are not listed due to their extraordinary nature. The four not listed are British Antarctic Territory (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff), the British Indian Ocean Territory (a military base), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (hosts only government officials and research station staff), and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (a military base where permanent residency is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus).\n- k. Includes Zanzibar.\n- l. Does not include the Rohingya people. Some regions were estimated by satellite. [34]\n- m. Includes the regions Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra and Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab, the disputed territory of Western Sahara administered by Morocco and excluding Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (see Western Sahara conflict).\n- n. Despite high reported precision, estimates vary widely. For 2024, the CIA gives an estimate of 40,121,552 [47] , while the UN gives an estimate of 42,045,000 [48] , based on the 1979 census and fertility, mortality and immigration estimates. [49] Official figure includes an estimated 1.5 million nomadic population.\n- o. Excludes the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine's de jure territory which is occupied by Russia (however, includes the Donbas region, partly occupied by Russia).\n- p. Excludes the external territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island.\nIf the question isn't related to the provided documents, politely inform the user that you can only answer questions about the selected documents."

It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the  list  being  primarily  based  on  the  ISO  standard  ISO  3166-1.  For  instance,  the  United  Kingdom  is considered  a  single  entity,  while  the  constituent  countries  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.119 billion as of 2024. [1]\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/CountrywisePopulationpdf/images/tmp93w2kbp__image_2.png)\n\n## Method\n\nFigures  used  in  this  chart  are  based  on  the  most  up-to-date  estimates  or  projections  by  the  national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2024 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\nBecause  the  compiled  figures  are  not  collected  at  the  same  time  in  every  country,  or  at  the  same  level  of  accuracy,  the  resulting  numerical  comparisons  may  create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union, [a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica. [2]\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n|     | Location                         | Population    | % of world   | Date        | Source

The European Union is a sui generis supranational union whose sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has 5.49% of the world's population - see \"Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface TGM table\" (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps0000 1/default/table?lang=en). European Commission.\n- b. According to UN estimates, India surpassed China by the end of April 2023. [4]\n- c. Refers to Mainland China; excludes China's special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\n- d. Includes the population of the India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.\n- e. Includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but excludes the territories of the United States.\n- f. Includes the population of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and GilgitBaltistan.\n- g. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics has a projection of 181 million for 2025, but this method derives from a base year of 2011. This same projection overcounted the population for 2022 by about 4.4 million. [13]\n- h. Includes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, administrative areas on the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia. The population does not include the four annexed Ukrainian oblasts. The Ukrainian government and most of the world's other states consider the Crimean Peninsula, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia parts of Ukraine's territory.\n- i. Includes the integral 18 regions of France (including 5 overseas departments and regions). Excludes France's 5 overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna, and the sui generis collectivity of New Caledonia, which are shown separately. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff) and Clipperton Island (an uninhabited state private property of France) are not listed at all due to their extraordinary nature.\n- j. Excludes the three British Crown Dependencies and the 14 British Overseas Territories, listed separately. Four British Overseas Territories are not listed due to their extraordinary nature. The four not listed are British Antarctic Territory (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff), the British Indian Ocean Territory (a military base), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (hosts only government officials and research station staff), and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (a military base where permanent residency is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus).\n- k. Includes Zanzibar.\n- l. Does not include the Rohingya people. Some regions were estimated by satellite. [34]\n- m. Includes the regions Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra and Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab, the disputed territory of Western Sahara administered by Morocco and excluding Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (see Western Sahara conflict).\n- n. Despite high reported precision, estimates vary widely. For 2024, the CIA gives an estimate of 40,121,552 [47] , while the UN gives an estimate of 42,045,000 [48] , based on the 1979 census and fertility, mortality and immigration estimates. [49] Official figure includes an estimated 1.5 million nomadic population.\n- o. Excludes the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine's de jure territory which is occupied by Russia (however, includes the Donbas region, partly occupied by Russia).\n- p. Excludes the external territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island.\nIf the question isn't related to the provided documents, politely inform the user that you can only answer questions about the selected documents."

It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the  list  being  primarily  based  on  the  ISO  standard  ISO  3166-1.  For  instance,  the  United  Kingdom  is considered  a  single  entity,  while  the  constituent  countries  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.119 billion as of 2024. [1]\n\n![Image](https://pdfparserdataset.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/docling/CountrywisePopulationpdf/images/tmp93w2kbp__image_2.png)\n\n## Method\n\nFigures  used  in  this  chart  are  based  on  the  most  up-to-date  estimates  or  projections  by  the  national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2024 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\nBecause  the  compiled  figures  are  not  collected  at  the  same  time  in  every  country,  or  at  the  same  level  of  accuracy,  the  resulting  numerical  comparisons  may  create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union, [a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica. [2]\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n|     | Location                         | Population    | % of world   | Date        | Source

The European Union is a sui generis supranational union whose sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has 5.49% of the world's population - see \"Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface TGM table\" (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps0000 1/default/table?lang=en). European Commission.\n- b. According to UN estimates, India surpassed China by the end of April 2023. [4]\n- c. Refers to Mainland China; excludes China's special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\n- d. Includes the population of the India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.\n- e. Includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but excludes the territories of the United States.\n- f. Includes the population of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and GilgitBaltistan.\n- g. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics has a projection of 181 million for 2025, but this method derives from a base year of 2011. This same projection overcounted the population for 2022 by about 4.4 million. [13]\n- h. Includes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, administrative areas on the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia. The population does not include the four annexed Ukrainian oblasts. The Ukrainian government and most of the world's other states consider the Crimean Peninsula, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia parts of Ukraine's territory.\n- i. Includes the integral 18 regions of France (including 5 overseas departments and regions). Excludes France's 5 overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna, and the sui generis collectivity of New Caledonia, which are shown separately. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff) and Clipperton Island (an uninhabited state private property of France) are not listed at all due to their extraordinary nature.\n- j. Excludes the three British Crown Dependencies and the 14 British Overseas Territories, listed separately. Four British Overseas Territories are not listed due to their extraordinary nature. The four not listed are British Antarctic Territory (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff), the British Indian Ocean Territory (a military base), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (hosts only government officials and research station staff), and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (a military base where permanent residency is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus).\n- k. Includes Zanzibar.\n- l. Does not include the Rohingya people. Some regions were estimated by satellite. [34]\n- m. Includes the regions Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra and Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab, the disputed territory of Western Sahara administered by Morocco and excluding Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (see Western Sahara conflict).\n- n. Despite high reported precision, estimates vary widely.
